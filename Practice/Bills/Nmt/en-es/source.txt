Am I wrong?
Poison can kill you.
You may park here.
It was entirely Tom's fault.

Mary was cruel to Tom.
It was not very cold yesterday.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Why do you want that anyway?
She was in the Americas last month.
That's not interesting.
Choose a food from each part of the menu.
Border fights were common.
That's no longer possible.

Originally they were farmers.

They remained in Tennessee.
You seem to have a crush on Tom.
He quietly knocked at the door.
Do you know how many people live in Australia?
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Don't make me feel bad about doing what I did.
Can you think of anything else?
Call the doctor right away.
I only told Tom what Mary told me.
I was going to do that.
Tom checked to make sure Mary was still sleeping.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
She resembles her aunt.
She kept her valuables in the bank for safety.
What exactly do you mean?
I'm not against outlawing guns.
You have three cars.
Can I come?
We love it here.
Tom wanted me to sit down and relax.
Why does Tom always look so tired?

Don't be so impatient.
Please push the table over this way.

Do you like tea or coffee?
Just have a seat.

I felt a deep pain.
What was that?

Which one do you like better?
He climbed the stairs.
I can't tell if you're serious or not.
That's me.
Did you see my camera?
Tom wants to know when Mary will go shopping.

It began to rain.
Some stores discount the price.
Please leave.
He is very depressed.
We rented a cabin by a lake.

That was a big mistake.

It's worth the money.
She called him on the phone.
Her grey hair makes her look older than she is.
The frame has to be sanded and varnished.
Tom couldn't make himself understood.
You won't be in time for school.
He denied knowing anything about it.
I broke your ashtray.
Thank you for reminding me about the meeting I have to attend.
I got up at 4:00, ate some food, then went back to sleep.
He's a very capable business man.
Pretty much everyone does that.
I hope they're friendly.
She lives with him in a small apartment.
If you have a minute, I'd like to talk to you about some problems.
He blew on his fingertips.
Tom is warming himself by the fire.
Tom doesn't trust Mary anymore.
It's hard to be a woman. One must think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse.
How would I know?
How did you get to know her?
My mother doesn't like to watch TV.
You're very close now.
The shower is broken.
Tom is very interested in water sports.
What does Tom think about this?
Just give it time.
I don't think that changes anything.
You need not go there.
The lake supplies the city with water.
It makes me sad to think of his death.
Easter begins next Wednesday.
My watch loses two minutes a day.
Tom seems to be lost.
I'm in Portugal.
Tom blew his top when he heard that Mary had gone out with John.
He kicked it.
Iceland was fantastic.
Is that pure gold?
I can't play the guitar very well.
How long did it take us to translate this book?
That farm belongs to Tom.
I don't think we should stop right now.
I don't know what you want and I don't care.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
I wish I could figure out how to control my appetite.
You did all you could.
Will you report everything truthfully?
French is the language of love.
Tom might be wrong.
Tell me it isn't true.
I mean no harm.
Don't touch the glass.
Why don't you leave, Tom?
I feel so sorry for Tom.
She kissed him on the forehead.
Tom went home angry.
I don't think your name's Tom.
Her only pleasure is listening to music.
I'm thinking there may not be enough time for me to eat before the meeting.
The ship sank to the bottom of the sea.
He is not the sharpest tool in the shed.
Finding his office was easy.
Leave the dog out for a while.
Tom should be home by 2:30.
Tom told Mary that it was too cold to go outside without a coat.
Tom detests Mary.
We visited Nikko the next day.
She doesn't live here any more.
Even when she thought about something else, ideas of death returned to her mind.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
Tom stared at the blank computer screen.
Are you two busy right now?
They stole horses and cattle.
Wait for the police.
She stayed at home by herself.
You don't have the time.
Come home with me.
She is being quiet for the moment.
We shouldn't be together.
I still love this bicycle.
They didn't make a deal.
I want to think about it.
She looked sadly at me.
I'm fixing something.
Why did Tom say that?
Boston is a very beautiful city.
I'm back.
I hate people who talk like that.
I love Chinese food.
Mother decided otherwise.
I'm already sick.
He's studying.
She lay awake all night.
What do you do?
He blocked my way.
He's pushing fifty.
He is being very careful.
I didn't want to insult Tom.
I thought Tom would give Mary your phone number.
Give me one good reason.
There were no jobs.
No one can keep me from going there.
Tom asked Mary about John.
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, sneeze or yawn.
I contacted my parents.
Do I need to go there?
"Was she a high school student?" "Yes, she was."
I've always hated biology.
Tokyo is a huge city.
That's why I think I'll be chosen.
I'll get them for you.
I'm not likely to be finished doing that before Monday afternoon.
She sat on the bank.
Can we talk now?
The man looked at me.
Tom spilled his drink.
I've got some dust in my eyes.
This bedroom doesn't get very much sunlight.
It's a mess.
You seem to be drunk.
Stay out of my way!
It's an error in judgment.
I often go there to meditate.
I am a student in a university.
They took turns drinking from the water fountain.
I noticed that she sat in the front row.
My upper right wisdom tooth hurts.
I am looking forward to receiving your favorable answer.
I use all kinds of software to study Chinese.
I hear only you.
The economy progressed slowly.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Everybody knows where Australia is.
Tom was the life of the party.
Can I drive the tractor?
We don't trust Tom.
Who resigned?
Who is it?
They won't budge.
You're not an expert at this job any more than I am.
Why didn't he come to the party?
I've lived in Kobe before.
It can be embarrassing.
I have a good English dictionary.
I overslept and was late for school.
Everybody knew Tom was in trouble.
Sri Lanka is a beautiful island.
I can hear Tom singing.
He still wants to come.
I played tennis.
Tom screamed.
Do you think that handguns should be made illegal?
Are you through with this book?
The tickets sold out within a week.
Tom and Mary were about to sit down for dinner when John knocked on the door.
Are you the owner of this house?
Where will we eat?
You've got me.
Tom is self employed.
These shirts are selling like hotcakes.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
I climbed the fence.
He practices playing the guitar until late at night.
Are you going to pay a visit to China this fall?
Tom is certain to come on time.
It's my last offer.
It's my business to investigate such things.
Even in India things changed.
When was your first love?
I like your sweater.
There are various kinds of candy in that bowl.
I do the laundry on Sundays.
I decided to continue doing that.
You didn't have to come so early.
You're stronger than the rest of us.
You should watch that movie if you get the opportunity.
You don't know who I am.
It took her a while to realize the situation.
Return immediately.
I hope to be a journalist.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
The birds were hungry.
The best thing is to tell the truth.
The same thing could be said about many other people.
I feel betrayed, but I still like her.
I moved.
Perhaps our emotions make us who we are.
Is there something you want to tell us?
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
She has large blue eyes.
It's very beautiful.
Tom won't stay.
It is difficult for foreigners to get used to Japanese food.
I don't remember seeing you before.
Give Tom a kiss.
When I woke up, he was gone.
I'll have my revenge.
The storm blew down a tree.
We've worked together for over thirty years.
Tom rode the horse bareback.
Speak louder.
I tried to focus my attention on reading.
These plants are all poisonous.
I'm sick and tired of the way you yell at me.
Tom thought it would be difficult for Mary to get a ticket to that concert.
I'm counting on you to be here on time.
I will have him repair this watch.
For some people, meditation is more effective than taking tranquilisers.
I don't play pool.
Say something.
Nowadays it is not unusual for a woman to travel alone.
All they had was each other.
I was happy to receive my paycheck.
They are very cheerful.
Nobody was tortured.
It doesn't hurt at all.
Is Tom awake?
I live with my parents.
I collect antiques.
I thought Tom would be different.
Tom was tortured and murdered.
Why isn't this working?
My meals are prepared by my mother.
There are a lot of places to see in Hokkaido.
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday.
I also like apples.
We talked about the question over a cup of coffee.
What is this nonsense?
She seems OK now.
Go ahead!
Can you open this door?
She turned to the left at the corner.
Keep an eye on this suitcase.
Write your address, please.
This medicine must not be placed within the reach of children.
You disgust me.

He sat up late last night.
They know nothing.
He always wanted to go to L.A.
I reached the station at six.
What did you open it with?
I'm not as rich as I was.
As she grew older, she became more beautiful.
Tom understood it completely.
When we are away from home, nothing gives us more pleasure than to receive a parcel from home.
Cook the rice.
That's a pretty necklace.
I hope you don't miss anything.
The howls grew louder and louder.
What was the outcome?
Who is that woman?
This is gold.
Do you remember me?
Tom left a large tip on the table.
The woman is drinking water now.
Who is Tom?
Can you open the window?
I grew up near a river.
They took off after Tom.
The dampness of the weather is bad for my health.
It's not good to stay up late at night.
Tom asked me if I knew Mary.
I have a nap almost every day.
Do you still need a loan?
The sink is full of dirty dishes.
Tom put a tape in the VCR.
No one is free from worldly cares.
I must get this work done by the day after tomorrow.
Someone stepped on my foot on the train.

The boxes vary in size from small to large.
When did you last see Tom?
The time is always right to do what's right.
Tom will have to leave the building.
That's not funny.
I got out of the car at 40th Street.
Save it on the external hard drive.
Use it or lose it.

Everybody laughed at me.
You've let me down.
He's taking a nap.
Tom doesn't like women who drink a lot.
She is a bad person.

When the police arrived, the thieves had disappeared.
I can see a lady and two dogs in the car.
You can probably guess what happens though.
Hide the money.
They're here because they're my friends.
My hobby is shopping.
What time is your plane scheduled to take off?
I'm listening.
Are you going to sit with me?
She is giving the baby a bath.

This is Tom.
Tom taught me how to surf.
I met a friend of Mary's.
Please explain why you can't come.
That will be funny.
I have a meeting today.

They're our clients.
Let's settle accounts.
How many books do you have?
He isn't a smoker.
Somebody's coming.
She wants to kiss him.
How far is it from here to the station?
At present, the cause of the disease is unknown.
I accept your apologies.
You should know it.

The people were evacuated because of the flood.
I don't love you anymore.

I now view life differently than I used to.
Just tell him the truth.
To the Hilton Hotel, please.
He wanted to come with us.
My father stopped drinking.
Tom peeled the carrots.
I want to go home.
I didn't have time to take a shower today.
He's crazy about you.
I have no interest in putting my money into your dreams.
Please forgive me.
I'll accompany you to the station.
The situation seemed out of control.
Is it ethical to give him the interview questions in advance?
It's just a matter of time.
I don't feel well at such a high altitude.
Sorry, what's your name?
They'll dance.
Is your wife tall?
You'd better not go out today.

It happened at a quarter past eleven.
We don't have much snow here even in the winter.
Tom had a hunch that Mary was seeing someone else.
I called her up.
I am 4 years younger than him.
I owe you a dinner.

We finished the work.
How long have you known her?
Every dog has his day.
I like your idea.
What a letdown!
Do you care for classical music?
Tom might go with you.
That changed everything.
This is all that I know about him.
I do not have any money.
The world is full of problems.
My friend said he had bought a new watch.
Is this your sack or his?
Why do you love me so much?
Thank you for the wonderful gift.

Tom wants to be friends with Mary.
We tied him up so that he wouldn't be able to escape.

I share everything with Tom.
I didn't tell anybody.
No matter what happens, I will never change my mind.
He managed to climb the mountain.
What time is the flight?
We received word of his death.
Don't make noise when you eat soup.
Have you been there before?
No one loves war.
This bike belongs to my younger brother.
When did you see her?

I don't know what we will do.
Are you usually early or late?
Their loss is our gain.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Do you have your laptop with you?
They peered inside.
Tom broke into Mary's car and stole what was hidden under the driver's seat.
Tom has his own life to live.
I'm in debt to my uncle for $10,000.
Today is my lucky day.
My life was in danger.
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
There was a pair of handcuffs on the bed.
Calm down and begin at the beginning.
It was so hot that I slept with the window open.
"That's a woman's job," said Tom.
You can answer it.

This isn't my money.

Everybody applauded.
Can you go to the movie now?
At first, I thought it might be a serious problem.
These machines aren't working now.
She did not disappoint him.
You will find the post office on your left.
The party was really boring.
He has a hat on.
Many things can be bought at the market.
We know Tom did it.
Tom looks quite a bit older than Mary.
Mary often hums songs under her breath while she works in the kitchen.
I want to be here.
I stayed home all day long reading novels.
This company's profit margin is very big.
I expect you to follow my orders.
The boy ran away.
She asked him some questions.
When did you come back from Boston?
What does your son do?
My father gets along with his friends.
We hope to meet you again.
This is my school.
Disneyland was established in 1955.

Tom wanted to say more, but he couldn't.
I didn't want to know.
Tom couldn't take his eyes off Mary.
I ran a race with him.
I'm kind of hungry, too.
If it were not for the sun, we could not live.
It doesn't look so bad.
Let me win for once.
Tom relaxed.
That's not a proper thing to say.
Tom never changed.
Tom has been watching TV all day.
You'll never stop me.
We wandered round the shopping center.
We often make mistakes.
I'm not the only one who can't do that.
My father is expecting you to phone him tomorrow.
She succeeded in getting herself elected as mayor.
I thought Tom was your enemy.
Tom was immediately worried.
It was far from certain.
We talked about French.
I'm angry with you.
We'll wait for you there.
It only took Mary a few minutes to set the table.
Let's play chess another time.
Where is that?
His life hangs on the judge's decision.
Can I ask something?
Tom forgot to take his medication this morning.
They were sunbathing on the beach.
I've just arrived in Boston.
It's a simple job.
I'll be brief.
She's a good person.
What just happened?
I didn't even know that existed.
Tom can be clumsy.
What do you feel like doing tonight?
Tom thinks we're dead.
He stood there with his eyes closed.
It is four centimeters thick.
What a heel!
I got here Monday night.
I don't want to marry you.
There were a few children in the room.
I need to know more details.
Tom is embarrassed.
I don't feel like helping you.

It's refreshing.
I'm sorry for the delay in responding.
I saw her a week ago today.
She has long hair.
Here's the address.
The pin pierced his finger and it began to bleed.
Do you want to talk to Tom?
You should make notes.
You must try and come to the party.
What season do you like the best?
This is the book I want to buy.
I looked inside the box.
Can you sleep?
You know people.
Where did you spend your holidays?
You're quite a liar.
I wonder who that girl is.
When I got home, I noticed that I had lost my wallet.

Let's quickly finish the remaining work and go out for some drinks.
Certain things are better left unsaid.
Tom cried for an hour.

You shouldn't have said that.
I'm a bit drunk. I think I should stop drinking now.
How are you now?

The club has more than fifty members.
Let's give Tom a big hand.
This year we had more snow than last year.
"Objection!" "Sustained!"
I stared at the man.
The leaves of the tree turned yellow.
Do you think you could make it before lunch?
Did you call your friend in Canada?

Are you from here?
I was no match for Tom.
You get more and more beautiful every day.

She was kind enough to give me good advice.
Why didn't Tom stop?
What are you going to drink?
May I call you tomorrow?
My friend studies Korean.
I wake him up at 6 every morning.

I grew up in the mountains.
It's easier to make plans than to carry them out.
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
He held out his hand to me.
That way I kill two birds with one stone.
They usually get home later than us.
Look at the blackboard, everyone.
I'm going to the restaurant.
I bet we'll have a test today.
Is there anything you can't do?
Tom causes me a lot of trouble.
Leave that box where it is.
He went to bed.
It looks as though this summer will be cold again.

Your idea is similar to mine.
Here is my album.
This is Tom's camel.
I am worried about my mother's health.
You don't know how worried I am.
What Tom says is often irrelevant.
I want to show you something in my office.
Welcome.

How long have you waited?
They're with me.
I was raised eating Mexican food.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
Tom might not know what he's supposed to do.
Don't ask for money.
It is better to live rich, than to die rich.
That sounds like French.
I am sorry that I have troubled you so much.
I want you to be my partner.
It would be good if I had a car.
I will ask him tomorrow.
It's not hard to find.
I'm behind him.
I thought you might want to talk about it.

I always wondered if you'd come back.
If Tom breaks up with Mary, he'll regret it.
That's what I've always said.
What's my room number?
We'd be safe there.

What are you sitting on?
"What happened?" "The car broke down."

Could I see your driver's license?
I think it's time for me to admit that I never cared about you.
I'm on your side.
She as well as her friends is fond of music.
She went to a movie the other day.
This book seems easy to us.
This doll costs only sixty cents.
Did you do this on your own?
There's something I want to try.
She likes to sing.
I'll go even if it rains heavily.
She wasn't able to meet him.
I've never told this to anyone.
You're my enemy.
I wouldn't recommend it.
Tom doesn't want to clean his room.
This needs to stop.
I can't help admiring his talent.
You're irresistible.
I speak English every day.
You must be more patient.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
My parents were satisfied with my grades this year.
Does he need to run so fast?
It's your move.
He was nearly run over by a car.
Is it sweet or sour?
We're in love.
There was a big fire last night.
May I say something?
I think that I could've done that by myself.
I was thinking about it.
Tom struck the wall with his fist.
You were never alone.

I want to do some shopping around here.
I almost choked on a piece of chicken bone.

I used to play the trombone.
I had my sister take a picture of me.
Tom suggested that we wait here.
This camera is not loaded with film.
Don't let that happen again!
I am proud of never being late for school.
He's very stingy.
This is my dream job.
Hey look, it's Tom.
Won't you go to the concert with me?

Revenge is sweet.
Tom sewed the button back on his shirt.
I want the fan.
It's not a good idea to do that.
My father came home at nine.
Tom doesn't understand Mary.
They say that he will never return.
She herself helped him.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
Glad to see you, Tom.
I have a boyfriend who loves me.
He bought a pair of shoes.
Tom shrugged.
It was cool.
I like honey.
Tom never read the book that Mary gave him.

It doesn't matter whether your answer is right or wrong.
Will he live?

Have you ever tasted such a good soup?
The story got more and more interesting.
They went fishing yesterday.
Tom thanked Mary for all her help.
I'm glad you reminded me about the meeting.
I don't like any of these hats.
Look in the phone book.
I think so.
Will you go with us?
She's two years younger than him.
You cannot swim here.
I'm totally confused.
He is dead and buried now.
He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
I'm sure she will become a great singer.
Look it up.
I'm going bald.
Hold on a second.
Yesterday, an explosion occurred at the fireworks factory.
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
That's what I wish.
What time do you want to meet?
Tom can't swim yet.
Tom should've let me do what I wanted to do.
We season with salt.
I'm not the only one who has done that.
Tom is different from other boys.
Tom is going to Harvard.
This child's very naughty.
We've got to get help.
Do you have any small change?
Do your homework now.
Tom convinced Mary to hire John.
Get me up at eight.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
Do you feel any better today?

Tom thinks that's crazy.
There's more wind today than yesterday.
He likes to travel alone.
Do you think such a thing is possible?
I heard they're going to raise our rent.
She expressed her thanks for the present.
I felt a touch of pain in my head.
Can someone please open the door?
His nose is bleeding.
It was a bad choice.
Tom is taking a bath now.
They won't be able to get up so early.
I think we've all made mistakes.
What do you want the list for?
The situation gets worse and worse.
He is the last man to do such a thing.
I owe you $30.
We are adjourned until 2:30.
The longer we waited, the more impatient we became.
You have to call Tom.
Tom has a good side and an evil side.
What languages do you know?
You will always be welcome.
Whose turn is it next?
She's but a child.
It was not until then that I realized my mistake.
Soft music is often conducive to sleep.
My driver's license expires at the end of this month.
I'm in a bad mood.
The lecture started on schedule.
Tom remained behind.
A bear can climb a tree.
Don't take chances.
Don't be evil.
He needs a cup of sugar.
Do you know whether she can speak English?
I hung up and called her back again.
Tom isn't tall.
My friend will be our guide.
She was too short to see over the fence.
What if I'm right?
This is the end.
Tom followed Mary home.
He is guilty of theft.
How did I let this happen?
The knife is dull.
He didn't fulfill his obligations.
Keep to the left.
I heard everything you said.
I have forgiven her already.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
Tom is by far the smartest kid in our class.
I wish I had known his name then.
Fantastic!
Would you like to leave a message for him?
Tom says that he heard a similar story from Mary.
I don't know what I'll do after Christmas.
What are we doing?
Tom has not yet been told of his father's death.
But I can't understand them very well.
I'm trying.
Your father's supporters are not limited to his friends.
They did it.
I didn't know where you were.
The result was really satisfying.
He failed the exam.
What time do you finish work?
I really miss the old days.
Call the police.
Tom wanted to know the time.
A doe is a female deer.
I like to make Mary laugh.
There's so much left for me to learn.
The lavishness of the party amazed everybody.
She could read when she was four.
What more can you say?
His policies were too progressive.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
You taught me well.
I suggest that you begin doing that right away.
I'd love to meet him.
Walk this way.
They were talking together like old pals.
It didn't take Tom long to realize he wasn't welcome there.
Hull was given immediate orders to invade Canada.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom told Mary something she didn't want to hear.
I'm remodeling.
Tom pointed to Mary.
She's such a lovely girl!
Tom is going to buy a new car next weekend.
Do you know whose bike this is?
Tom has a lot of people to see tomorrow morning.
What's your favorite home-cooked food?
What places would you like to visit?
She isn't married.
You can't survive without money.
That should be enough.
It's not that I seriously like him. I just find him very attractive.
Tom won't interfere.
I prefer the flavor of fresh-water fish.
Am I fat?
I couldn't tell what color his shirt was because it was too dark outside.
You're small.
These are my friends.
You've got the wrong person.
Tom is never on time.
I'm tired of your whining.
"Can somebody help me?" "I will."
Tom is shouting at Mary.
I have neglected you so long that I feel a bit shy in visiting you.
Any watch will do as long as it is cheap.
The Japanese word "tatoeba" means "for example."
Tom shut the door quietly.
Let's be best friends forever.
What she says is true.
You're so predictable.
He made up his mind quickly.
She helped the old man cross the road.
Tom told us that we would eat as soon as we got to the cabin.
Tom nearly fell off his chair.
The old man walked across the road carefully.
Brush your teeth well.
She is being blackmailed by him.
The radio is on.
They continued eating as if nothing had happened.
Can you meet him?
Why is she hiding?
I'm sitting on a very small chair.
No one answered.
He drank orange juice out of a bottle.
Could you speak a little louder please?
The detective disguised himself as an old gentleman.
The boy has a newspaper.
I don't work on Sunday.
Sometimes I get jealous.
A lion is strong.
Come along with us.
This movie is worth watching.
To prevent the disease from spreading quickly was not an easy task.
I don't know how deep the lake is.
Just observe your cat and you will get to know him.
I will read a book.
I want to be alone!
I never want to hear his name again.
I think it's better not to lend him a hand.
My family are all early risers.
You like me, don't you?
I just feel so helpless.
Let's meet at Shibuya Station at six.
Tom wrote the script.
The train has already left.
They didn't know what to do with him.
You have to come with me.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
A true scientist wouldn't think like that.
She gave birth to her first child at twenty years old.
I can't tell you how much your support means to us.
I think we can help each other.
Tom didn't know who to believe.
It was nearly noon.
You're witty.
Tom met Mary.
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night.
Everything seemed normal.
Tom is in terrible physical condition.
You have a good memory.
I looked for my room.
Tom can't run as fast as Mary.
I like candy.
We're hiding.
They got blamed, but it wasn't their fault.
Would you mind my moving your car?
Do you think we can help Tom?
I'm forgetful.
Tom was aloof.
I don't know why.
I had a pretty happy childhood.
He knocked at the door again and again, but there was no answer.
He didn't do it on purpose.
The idea of seeing my mother thrills me very much.
I've already eaten.
He studies English, but he's also studying German.
Nobody can live to be two hundred years old.
She made coffee for all of us.
He sent a card to Mary.
Get your mind out of the gutter!
I like your frankness.
Tom is the happiest person in the world right now.
This is remarkable.
I thought you wanted to wait.
It snowed yesterday.
Do people ever accuse you of being snobbish?
You're not the only one that was hurt.
I can stay in the car while you go into the bank.
I can't check my mail. The server is down.
He came from the south.
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Tom knows we aren't busy.
The shop did not want him.
Let's go to a concert together.
You're going to need your umbrella.
Take this medicine every six hours.
Tom, I need your help.
That can't be Tom.
I know that would make me happy.
The twins look exactly alike.
Something must've happened down there.
What's your favorite baseball team?
I'd do anything for you.
I realized I was off my guard.
You may take photos outside this museum, but not inside.
They don't belong here.
Spain is the host country for the Olympics in 1992.
That bridge isn't long.
You're powerless.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
She traveled by bus.
Tom slumped back in his chair.
Where did you see the woman?
Sit up straight.
Does anyone speak English?
That makes no sense at all.
The truth hurts.
Do what you like.
The wall is partly covered with ivy.
Every morning she helps her mother to prepare breakfast in the kitchen.
Tom knows it was a mistake.
I will give you a laptop.
Tom left the lights on all night.
I'll be up on the roof.
Don't raise your voice at me.
He explained the literal meaning of the sentence.
He tried to comfort her, but she kept crying.
He has been to America.
They celebrated his birthday with a big party.
Can I talk to Ryoko again before you hang up?
Be confident.
Tom is heavily armed.
I have to go to work now.
This bird cannot fly.
Even though he's a policeman, he's afraid of thieves.
A red light was glowing in the dark.
He was tired then.
I've never thought about giving up.
Tom continued working.
I've had a really tough day.
My parents gave me a house when we got married.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
I regard him as an enemy.
How many days will you stay in Boston?
Nobody knows.
Tom was scared.
Everything happens for a reason.
Do you need more money?
I'd like to brush my teeth.
I feel like crying.
You let me down, Tom.
Do you speak Filipino?
It's easy to make and it's cheap.
She caught hold of my arm so she wouldn't fall.
They were not amused.
I couldn't put up with that noise any longer.
I know it's wrong.
Tom never talks about what he wants to do in the future.
I came here to rescue you.
The problem is that I don't have enough money.
The baby cried itself to sleep.
I thought she was 30 at most.
Tom was looking for some people to help him move his piano.
Tom can't go out because he has a lot of homework.
Tom is a famous portrait painter.
Consider the following scenario.
Wait here.
That's our house.
Can we go?
Why don't you just shut up?
Try this one.
Why are you so sad?
Why are people always so cynical?
Do you want to dance?
Tom thinks that's strange.
That meeting was a waste of time.
The air felt a little cold.
If you get sleepy, tell me.
I intended to go with her, but I was too busy.
I thought I had enough money.
It will not be long before she comes back.
I'd like to have this film processed.
He is a handsome man.
Four multiplied by two is eight.
Tom rushed into the office.
I like meat, cheese and tomato sandwiches.
I couldn't go to your birthday party.
Tom knows Mary's in love with John.
She idolized him.
We're about your age.
Tom has done it before.
It's the perfect size.
They want more money.

Tom lives in a house without running water.
How do you feel?
I'm not going anywhere.
That's a good idea!
Keep it in mind for the next time.
He's nervous and easily frightened.
A full moon is shining bright in the sky.
My feet are freezing.
He begged me to stay.
Some people like summer, and others like winter.
Can't we start over?
I had to do it.
Take some money just in case you need it.
He tidied up his room.
I'm used to staying up late at night.
You can't be too careful when doing this experiment.
That guy stole my wallet! Stop him!
How could you make such a mistake?

The boy remained silent.
Take off your wet clothes.
Of all the books published recently, only a few are worth reading.
I'd like to open an account.
Tom is a house painter.
I'm not as talkative as you.
I'd like a vodka and tonic.
My life is complete.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be homeless.
Tom has a message for Mary.
I don't want to hear any more of your complaining.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
I haven't forgotten you.
It might take a little while.
Open the bottle.
How many friends do you have?
I'm anxious to meet her.
When I woke up, there was a burglar in my room.
Tom and Mary eventually broke up.
Stop grumbling.
Disorder prevails in the street.
Actually, I just made that up.
She broke my heart.
None of these things surprise me.
The boy was so tired that he couldn't take one more step.
You can get in touch with him at his home tonight.

Although Tom is sick, he plans to get his homework done on time.
Tom wondered what Mary was making in the kitchen.
That university was my first choice.
What was the fight about?
Is he a doctor?
Tom is naked.
It amazed us to hear that things were so cheap.
I told you to stay put.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
No matter what happens, I am prepared.
I let Tom in the house.
I don't want to discuss it.
As soon as they return, I will telephone you.
Move along, please.
I think Tom is charming.
Keep an eye on my bag while I buy a ticket.
I was just here yesterday.
Who runs things here?
I have not seen him for a long time.
Are you two friends?
Don't go to Boston.
I run five miles a day.
Tom thought he was finished, but Mary told him that he wasn't.
You can start right now.
I think Tom is a liar.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come back.
I'm confident that Tom will do what he says he'll do.

Tom watched TV yesterday.
That would be awkward.

Are you coming?

Be thorough.
Everyone's watching Tom.
It's hot today.
Almost all of the passenger in the bus were asleep when the accident happened.
Do you see the entrance of the park?
Tom wondered why many people in America think that baseball is more interesting to watch than soccer.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
They were enjoying themselves.
I know French.
I'm shorter than him.
He is tall.

Fill up the tank.
I've got one like that already.
Didn't you hear the scream?
These old people are my uncles.
Tom had a little trouble finding Mary's house.
We took him to the hospital right away.
I have never fallen in love with any girl.
I'm going to have to talk to Tom.
Where do you all live?
Tom looks surprised.
I asked Tom to come yesterday, but he didn't come.
Tom is Mary's best friend.
It freaks me out.
You don't like Tom very much, do you?
Don't you want to know?
We are hoping for your quick recovery.
I am staying at a hotel in New York.
Some day you will come to realize the importance of saving.
Tom says he can't imagine life without Mary.
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
Tom turned off the light and went to sleep.
I'm so glad I could help.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
Don't play dumb. I know you.
I don't know if I will have time to do it.
Would you like to eat?
I thought you said Tom was dangerous.
For here, or to go?
Have you ever been on TV?
What time do you go to work?
I'll help Tom.

I smell gas.
She argued with him and then hit him.
The station is to the west of the hotel.
His wife is our Italian teacher.
It was hard to figure out what Tom was trying to say.
It saved me.
I'll warn Tom.
Tom did have fun.
Tom was absolutely terrific.
Tom could be in Boston for a long time.
I assumed there must be something else we had to do.
They say she is the kindest woman on earth.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
You will see that I am right.
Tom was wrong to refuse Mary's help.
We're always careful.
As soon as we sat down, she brought us coffee.
Tom allowed his dog to run free.
I want you to have a copy of this.
When you can't do what you want, you do what you can.

I'm restless.
Let's get together again next year.
He could not forsake his friend in trouble.
I got a bonus.

It was very hard for me to find your apartment.
What's new?
Always arrive on time.
I'd do it again.
Call for help.
She is related to him.
Lots of people get married on Saturdays.
He doesn't want it.
I decided to leave the hotel.
The door needs another coat of paint.
The curtains were all open.

Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
Tom is learning programming.
They want to learn English.
Now move on.
Are you able to swim?
The university's near here.

I will give you a new bicycle for your birthday.
Have you seen Tom's room?
We'll die sooner or later.
What's the oldest thing you own?
I must speak with you alone.

He was alone in the room.
The hard work paid off.
That is no business of his.
I'm astonished.
We've run out of water.
Tom has a very large ego.
Your English has improved considerably.
Tom got into Mary's car.
You shouldn't judge a man by his appearance.
I only drink water.
Why are you guys so angry?
Today I've learned a valuable lesson.
I've drunk way too much coffee today.
She made him a simple dinner.
This could mean war.
He acted like a madman.
Don't say such a thing again.
It must be hard for you.
All his hopes evaporated when he lost his only son in the war.
Sometimes I struggle to speak English.
That'll change.
My younger sister has two sons, which means I have two nephews.
Too bad you have to leave already.
I'll show you where.

They were scared at the sight of the ghost.
Your wish has come true.
Tom led us into a trap.
My doctor told me to stay at home for a week.
Tom always seems to be in a bad mood.
I'm sure you knew that.
I don't believe she would understand it.
I imagine that Tom will eventually be caught and put in prison.
We surrendered.
What Tom really wanted was a rest.
He asked me what I had been doing.
There are hundreds of books in his studio.
I am pressed for time.
He doesn't show his true feelings.
I feel your pain, buddy.
Go to the hospital.
How far is it from here to Ueno?
We are afraid of death.
How's the weather?
It would be sad if that were true.
How many wives have you had?
There are many apple trees in the garden.
His failure was due to his idleness.

I prefer to walk.
Please explain the rule to me.

Do you want me to leave?
You should know that by now.
That student is very active.
Tom burned his fingers on a hot frying pan.
He'll come on foot or by bicycle.
Get out of my bed.
How about a cup of coffee?
This is the house where I live.
You're very brave.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't have stayed in Boston.
That's no excuse.
We made inquiries into his past.
Calm down.
Tom had to admit that Mary was right.
Do you have a boyfriend back home?
I got out of the taxi.
See you in three weeks.
Nobody says you can't go fishing.
Tom wouldn't approve.
Break it down.
She trembled with fear.
His bark is worse than his bite.
Where is the library?
I haven't had my breakfast yet.
We both laughed.
The sisters look like each other.
Are you for or against his idea?
All you do is party.
Make it brief.
I think they're happy.
Tom is dead.
The milk went sour.
We need to do this report again.

Tom gave up all hope.

Where's the nearest museum?
That wasn't so long ago.
Being with you makes me happy.
I heard every word.

Tom said he had a plan.
Just imitate what he does.
Tom is my ex.
I never want to make you angry.
She speaks loudly.
I awoke to find everything had been a dream.
The work must be completed at once.
It was one of the best nights I've had.
Driving relaxes me.
I'm likely to still be doing this tomorrow.
Tom abandoned the project because he didn't have enough money.
Tom is wearing the sunglasses he bought yesterday.
My name isn't on the list.
I saw Tom a few minutes ago.
Tom meant what he said.
Someone has torn two pages out of this book.
How do you say "hello" in French?
What crimes have you committed?
What's the matter with Tom?
I think that everybody knows.
Did you go to London that day?
Actually, it's very easy to learn.
It cannot always be perceived by the naked eye.
Don't repeat that word in God's house.
For Tom, getting fired was an unexpected shock.
Tom and I want you to come with us.
Let's go!
Despite everything, the world is still beautiful.
It can't be that he is busy.
Did you know that Tom got married last week?
They don't teach you that in school.
You are on the wrong train.
I'm not busy today.
Tom, I want you to come with me.
I'll pick up the photographs at six o'clock.
The competition is fierce.
It must've been tough for you.
Many families left to make a new life on the frontier.
I changed the lock on my door.
We expect that he'll help us.
I need to feed the dog.
Keep talking.
He didn't say anything.
How does this work?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That wasn't my mistake.

Has Tom ever been married?
What did you do with your camera?

I'm going to call Tom right now.
We need to raise prices.
What woke you up?
Which one is your favorite?
Quiet, please.
Supplies of oil are not infinite.
May I see your passport, please?
I just need one more chance.
We were eating lunch together.
So where were you?
She loves us.
How do I get to your house?
When the bomb exploded, I happened to be there.
Do ghosts really exist?
I love the sound of children laughing.
Let me think this over.
I was born in 1988 in York.
He asked me whether she was coming.
May I use the toilet?
I got up at seven this morning.
We're waiting for the shop to open.
I'll send you the link.
We'll meet in the theater.
Tom is bald.
No one knows.
It's just an expression.
I need to go get some money out of the bank.
I have a big black dog.
Whose is this?
Why is it that you are always late?
It's a pity they're getting divorced.
Tom gave Mary a watch.
Leave tomorrow.
I haven't eaten for days.
These days, kids no longer play in the street.
He likes sleeping.
Unless there is a miracle, we won't be able to make it on time.
When's Tom due back?
Who wants another piece of cake?
Is it still raining?
Tom might get sick.
Tom no longer works here.
I will do my best to finish it.
Some people like baseball, others like soccer.
Tom never seems to finish anything.
Please tell me about your problem.
He took us to the zoo.
That's my sole concern.
He was going accept the offer, but thought better of it.
Revolutions that don't succeed are soon forgotten.
Don't forget to call me.
I decided to study all night long.
You haven't got much time.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom?
What do you do with your clothes when they are worn out?
I decided I wouldn't do that.
Tom has more important things to worry about.
The office seems very busy today.
Let's wait and see.
The cat seems extremely happy.
He is no stranger to me.
Tom got into his car, closed the door and drove away.
He looked as if he had been ill.
Do you have a cellphone?
I like the way that smells.
Tom was held hostage.
The rules have changed.
You're so negative.
I hope things will change.

When she was reading the letter, she looked sad.
There are many bridges in this city.
I heard some students complain about the homework.
Considering everything, my father's life was a happy one.
Don't make a fool of me.
When was it that you first met her?
I spent two hours watching television last night.
I wanted to say something, but I was too scared.
Nobody's been hurt.
I know you don't remember me.
What were we thinking?
Tom was wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans.
It was a stupid idea.
Tom helped Mary take off her jacket.
I'm just a little surprised.
I hate to eat alone.
Get out of my bed.
Give me a reason.
He doesn't need to get up so early.
We enjoyed the cool breeze that came from the river.
I think it's kind of stupid.
I hope all your dreams come true.
Those are not your chairs.
Tom works very hard, but not as hard as Mary.
Tom let me down.
I am happy to hear your voice.
They loaded the truck.
I just like to daydream.
Tom wants to eat fried rice.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
I started sailing last year.
What do horses eat?
Tom was unable to conceal his surprise.
I manage to live on a small income.
Do you need this book?
Tom said he hadn't had a good home-cooked meal for a long time.
The boy's problems are physical, not mental.
You taught us that.
He is in great trouble.
Tom solved the puzzle.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
Let's kiss.
He moved to Tokyo.
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
I was fat when I was younger.
It seemed that her family had moved to Hokkaido.
That girl over there is very fat.
Why is it important to eat healthy food?
You must stay with me.
This is the one I want.
What happened this morning?
He was re-elected mayor.
I want to stay with you no matter what happens.
I have several friends who speak French well.
Tom didn't know which bus to take.
I realize the effort you have put into this project and I really appreciate it.
Tom thinks you're lying.
You'll be safe here.
Their party won the most votes in the election.
Taste this wine to see if you like it.
How long have you played soccer?
You have to eat regularly.
Say good night, Tom.
Winter is coming on.
Are you proud of your father?
She didn't try to translate the letter.
Nowadays there are no ninjas or samurais in Japan.
Our sales are decreasing.
Tom ignored the suggestion.
There is a church across the street.
Do you want this shirt?
I saw Tom die.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
The new building is enormous.
I really want to spend some time alone with Tom.
Tom invested all his money in the company that Mary and her father managed.
They are not coming today.
I have so many things I don't need.
He had his wallet stolen.
As far as I know, he has never come on time.
All of the students have to wear the same uniform.
There are more important things in life.
History tends to repeat itself.
What are you learning?
Dozens of young people attended the demonstration.
I don't blame Tom for his decision.
Stay right there.
Tom likes learning French.
I turned the doorknob.
We'll be leaving tomorrow.
Don't resort to violence.
Mom is making a cake.
It seems that he was late for the meeting yesterday.
I'm going to need your help.
You can stop now.
I did it a few times.
I could not convince him of his mistake.
If anyone can do it, you can.
I went to school yesterday.
Tom often screens his calls.
That dress looks stunning on you.
You must be from Australia.
He won a bronze medal.
Don't forget to wash your hands.
I want to change my reservation.
We have to get out of here.
I think we should stop talking about this and move on to another topic.
In case of fire, dial 119.
Explain exactly what the reasons are.
He's swimming now.
Do you know the name of this flower?
You're a racist.
Are your hands clean?
Tom works in agriculture.
This one is similar to that one.
We think a disgruntled employee was the one who planted the bomb.
You will gain nothing from doing that.
I don't mind it at all.
I'm getting thinner.
He has a book.
Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
Are you satisfied?
She advised him to go there alone.
