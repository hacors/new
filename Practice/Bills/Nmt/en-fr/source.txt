I need space.
Does that mean something to you?
I don't see anything strange.

What did you do at school today?
I wasn't in a hurry.
I gave it back.

How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
I want to hear all about it.
He was perfect.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
I'll take the stairs.
It looked funny.

They are not tired.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.

I'm such a fool.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.

You didn't drink that water, did you?
I often hiccup.
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
It's about time.
I want to make sure you know what to do.
How much TV do you watch?
It's starting to cool off.
What a smart guy!
Let me call you back.
Who came up with that idea in the first place?
This decision is final.
Don't use this faucet.

Are you telling me you're not involved?
You're smarter than me.
My son isn't the only one who enjoys eating her cooking.
This is a kind of watermelon.

Everything I did, I did for Tom.
Do you have any small change?
Please show me another one.
"Where are you going?" "To the movies."

Could you get it for me now?
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything.

That's no way to speak to your parents.
You're either with me or you're against me.
I've been looking all over for you.
We're a couple.
He came downstairs.
I was asked to wear a wire.
I love my parents.
Are they cops?
I would prefer to speak to you in private.
The last time I saw Tom was in October.
She has three times as many dictionaries as you do.
I can't stand this hot weather.
She hired him as an interpreter.
Don't you have a full-time job?
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
Can you complete the job in two days?
I'm strict.
I knew that someone would come.
I spent the whole day in the park.
Tom rinsed off the plates and put them into the dishwasher.
We don't have that.
I need to get myself a new pair of glasses.
I agree with you on that point.
Things have been pretty tough lately.
Anyone hurt?
Things are starting to get interesting.
I want to know how you know that.
I've been sent to relieve you.
It's dangerous!
Enjoy your day.
He was shorter than me.
Tom said that he didn't know Mary's address.
You still haven't told me what your phone number is.
Don't worry about that.
Your cat is overweight.
That's fantastic.
I guess so.
I heard it on the news today.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I want you to get your own place.
You have blood on your hands.
I'll go if you insist.
Her garden is a work of art.
You are liable for the debt.

Don't you believe me?
He died soon after the accident.
You said we'd never catch Tom.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Can I see this?
What makes you think I'm hiding something?
They've changed a lot.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
Just do what I did.
There is nothing to worry about.
I'll leave it up to you.
Get back into your car.
He wants you to come home.
I need to have a talk with you.
My father made me a delicious lunch.
It doesn't surprise me that you know.
It seems that you're not having fun in here.
We did not get your letter until yesterday.
Thank you for picking me up.
I'm afraid of dogs.
There's no hope.
Come off it!
While I was waiting for the bus, I witnessed a traffic accident.
They abandoned the ship.
Who's your boyfriend?
I promise I'll pay you back.
He hired a private investigator.
I thought they'd heard us.
My mother cannot drive a car at all.
We watched a movie.
Tom wasn't the first person here.
We depend on you.
I want another chance.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
Aren't they Englishmen?
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I haven't had time to look for what you wanted.
Are you in favor of or against that policy?
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Tom has three dogs.
You should do that now.
Can you give me a cup of tea?
There's something I want to discuss with you.
I have homework to finish.
He went there instead of his father.
She came to like the new teacher.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
I've already told you what I think.
What're you doing here?
I go swimming every chance I get.
You are both pretty and kind.
The leader of the party is a famous scientist.
So what are you talking about?
Who's your favorite actor?
Why don't you run for student council?
Let's see if Tom can help.
The dove is a symbol of peace.
He picked up the book.
Pour me a glass of wine.
What did Tom really want?
She feels bad today.
We were held up for two hours on account of an accident.
They arrived there before dawn.
His daughter is sick.
How do you intend to do that?
Where do I claim my baggage?
I watch television.
I was allowed to take a week off.
I'm sure they'll be very happy together.
I need them.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Tom died before his son was born.
Tom might be right.
Did I say I was finished?
Are you ready for the trip?
She doesn't do anything else.
Where can we get lunch?
I've got to get ready for school.
Fill the jars with water.
He was a real drunkard.
We need to find out who he is and who he's working for.
You're right, of course.
Stop yelling!
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Tom doesn't want to leave.
There's no danger now.
It may, indeed, be a mistake.
I didn't get any of that.
We're safe in here, aren't we?
Smoking will do you a lot of harm.
What do we have to do?
All the guys teased me about it.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
I'll spend the night here.
I'm sure we can trust Tom.
Why do you need to do that?
That is really good news.
Keep it secret, please.
Are you ready now?
I haven't eaten anything yet today.
That's not really my problem.
That's entirely possible.
You'd better go to bed at once.
Have you got any ideas yet?
I'd like to see your ticket, please.
Did you know that?
There is a right time for everything.
I'm an attorney.
They were waiting for the gate to open.
Prepare yourself.
Don't touch anything without asking.
You're double-parked.
I'll come back later.
I live in Kobe.
I know the man you came with.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
We still have a ways to go.
Wash your hands before you handle the food.
You should always ask for permission first.
They're happy.
I just want to have fun.
She was painfully skinny.
The rooms in this hotel are pretty basic.
I got my hands quite dirty.
Tom can't say for sure when Mary will arrive.
Take your shoes off before you come into the room.
Somebody stepped on his foot.
We'll be careful.
Did you like it?
Don't leave!
I didn't really mean that.
I don't know what you want to do.
Where can I find an outlet for all my anger?
I've experienced the same thing.
You'll soon get used to speaking in public.
Tom's drowning.
What're you writing?
I exchanged stamps with him.
His hobby is collecting stamps.
Get the kid to bed.
That boy is very clever.
The fighting lasted about three months.
He is my classmate.
I'm a year younger than Tom.
Won't you have some more tea?
I never oversleep.
I hope Tom proves me wrong.
You know as well as I do that Tom isn't a very good singer.
They agreed to give us an interview.
Tom is whistling.
Do you know Tom's wife's name?
Do you have a ticket?
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Why did you kill the snake?
How awesome is that?
Don't you think we deserve Tom's respect?
He looks just like his mother.
I think I know why you're here.
They're mad at you.
I have a lot of work to do.
I felt like an idiot.
Isn't that what you said?
January is the first month of the calendar.
I think we're ready to go.
Just give me your name and address.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
Nature is full of mysteries.
I'm really shocked.
He didn't reveal his identity.
They opened the door.
I feel lucky to have been chosen.
We're committed.
Tom joined the marching band.
I'd like you to leave immediately.
Tom thanked the chef.
I really like that car.
I don't have a washing machine.
I've been saying that all along.
You have only to answer the first question.
It was very hard for her to suppress her emotions.
Please don't waste water.
I had a hard time finding his house.
We organized a farewell party for her.
Writers often refer to a dictionary.
I'm beginning to hate her.
You need a job.
There are only three cookies left.
He accepted my idea.
They're of no consequence.
Where did he do it?
I don't have a chain saw, but I know someone who does.
You're too skinny.
Yes. You're absolutely right.

The weather changed suddenly.
Do you think animals have souls?
The boy almost drowned.
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary.
I want vengeance.
I want you to get off my back.
I want to thank you all for a job well done.
He applied for the job and got it.
He broke down when he heard the bad news.
Give me a coffee, please.
I like spring the best.
I was really frustrated.
We hope to finish planting the field before the sun sets.
"May I use this pencil?" "Yes, you may."
Whose is this bicycle?
I thought you were dead.
My father won't allow me to do that.
What are we afraid of?
I told her once and for all that I wouldn't go shopping with her.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
Tom has just resigned.
I see you are ready.
If you want to lose weight, the best thing to do is to eat properly and get a lot of exercise.
It started to rain.
There are no chairs in this room.
Does the hat fit well?
He stuck to his promise.
I am expecting some serious work from you.
We didn't hear you come in.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
I want to join your team.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
Prices went to amazingly low levels.
The leaves of the trees have turned red.
He sounds angry.
I'm fine.
Don't you think we deserve some answers?
My father works hard because he wants to give us everything we need.
Put the rifle down.
I think that was very funny.
You have no proof.
Tom eventually joined the navy.
What do you say we go there?
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
Whose dog is this?
I felt the same way.
I had a strange dream.
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
"Thanks for the help." "Don't mention it."

Give me a break.
The cat was basking in the sun.
This soup is really good.
She's promised to give me a ring.
She took my hand.
She went upstairs.
When will you arrive?
I forgot your phone number.
He couldn't have put it more plainly.
I've tried.
The lavishness of the party amazed everybody.
I have been waiting for almost half an hour.
A dangerous criminal has escaped from the insane asylum.
It's a matter of survival.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?

What kind of fruit juice do you have?
He is said to have died here.
I believe in getting up early.
I never thought it would be this bad.
He sat at the edge of the stream.
Do you think her story is false?
While I was waiting for the bus, I saw a traffic accident.
Don't tell me what I know.
She really got on my nerves.
Tom wanted to be sure.
Let's take a rest here.
Did I forget anyone?
What did you do this summer?
What am I going to tell Tom?
She works for a large American corporation.
Let's go to a concert together.
Don't leave town.
You must bear in mind what I've just said to you.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Tom denied having met Mary.
Did you call me up last night?
Tom would've been very proud of you.
She stole a lot of money from him.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Tom guessed the right answer.
I was hoping you could help.
I don't want to go back there.
Their houses are located near the sea.
She pressured him to quit his job.
She visited him once a year.
You can't have this.
I am playing the piano now.
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost.
Tom says he taught himself how to do that.
Let's stop talking and start working.
She can count from one to ten.
Boys are stupid.
There's no mention of it here.
The last thing I want to do now is clean the bathroom.
I didn't tell anybody.
How can you be so sure?
If I screw up, what's the worst that can happen?
Those photos are hers.
Familiarity breeds contempt and children.
You're unforgettable.
He doesn't like to lose.
I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
I just couldn't go through with it.
You can't do two things at once.
He licked his fingers.
Do you miss it?
Tom is listening to music.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
It was a forced smile.
What did you just say?
Yes, we can go.
Have I already told you this?

When will you come back?
He always leaves the window open when he sleeps.
I've never seen anything like it.
That man is strong.
I caught a cold two days ago.
His sudden death was a tragedy.
I'll try to find one.
I don't like it, either.
I refuse to reply to these charges.
That's where you're mistaken.
He was surprised by the news.
Tom always drinks his coffee black with no sugar.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
You're pretty.
I'm strongly opposed to a compromise.
She stopped talking.
We went out for a pizza last night.
It's inadequate.
How often do you go abroad?
I am very thankful to you for your advice.
They're mad at you.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.

Was there much damage?
I should stop procrastinating.
Why don't you play something for me?
She knows everything.
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?
I enjoyed the attention.
I really do miss my parents a lot.
Are you ready to go?
You can't tickle yourself.
What insects have you eaten?
Aren't you annoyed by that?
Quality is more important than quantity.
May I open a can?
Read it to me.
I told Tom not to come.
This is too short.
What kind of question is that? Do you really expect me to answer that?
I miss Boston.
Are you enthusiastic?
I'm going to open the wine.
I'm not here to fight.
Show it to her.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
I got a famous singer's autograph.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
Apparently I'm adopted.
Can I help you find something?
At the most, the trip will cost $1,000.
Mama cried.
I decided to tell her that I love him.
His memory never ceases to astonish me.
How did you get that nickname?

I've been thinking about it.
I am yours and you are mine.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the governor.
Go on ahead.
I spend a lot of time on the phone.

I resent that.
You need to rest.
You know what song I want to sing.
Where are they meeting?
I would've said yes.
I don't like to be away too long.
What does what happened last night have to do with what's happening today?
She advised him not to go.

They probably don't know.
Please answer me.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Down with the king!
The fact that I'm here proves that I'm innocent.
What a beautiful scene!
They abandoned the ship.
For here, or to go?
Timing is everything.
We'll stand.
Don't worry. It's a common mistake.
I don't need to be here right now.
I can't understand the problem.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
They left without me.
I promise to work hard.
Let me handle it.
Please write your name at the bottom of this paper.
I moved into a new apartment.

Don't come so early next time.
Where did you get this information?
Tell me what I did wrong.
Tom didn't know who Mary was planning to marry.
She urged him to study harder.
What time is your appointment?
The rise in house prices enabled him to sell his house at a big profit.
Yesterday, I was at Tom's house.
I ran out of breath.
Don't get so excited!

Why don't you stay there?
A fallen leaf floated on the surface of the water.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
Who would you like to speak with?
I can never stay angry at Tom for very long.
Don't make noise.
There's something important I need to tell you.
I don't want to listen to you.
Nice timing.
I saw you.
You're young and strong.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
We know who they are.
Tom doesn't appear to be paying attention.
Did you buy a new phone?
Cheese is made from milk.
Don't get angry. It won't help you.
It's your decision.
Maybe it was just a nightmare.
Go look for it.
Why bother?
I'll meet you at the usual place.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
Why did they hire you?
Hang that picture on the wall.

I spent the whole day reading that novel.
We need to get it done before tomorrow.
All citizens should respect the law.
How did last night go?
Many friends came to see me off.
Would you care for a little wine?
What did you try to do?
Tom is going to get angry if you keep doing what you're doing.
They talked over the plan for hours.
We meant no harm.
Now he has nothing to live for.
Don't come again.
She tried a third time.
I don't understand German.
He is still angry.
Shall we order?
Tom has three secretaries.
A coin dropped out of his pocket.
Air the futon.
It's not easy raising children.
Maybe that's not such a good idea.
He danced all night long.
How much rent do you pay for the apartment?
I'm crazy.
The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.
He was embarrassed.
We grow wheat here.
I don't feel comfortable here.
What did you do this summer?
I began to sweat.
Are you the one who wrote this?
Attach a recent photograph to your application form.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
Do you really believe those stories?
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
This room heats easily.
When did you hear the sound?
I don't think I like it.
I don't want to be different.
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday.
I need something else.
God has a plan for you.
He speaks English.
Nothing like that will happen again.
Mary doesn't dance much now, but I know she used to a lot.
Of course, I knew it was dangerous.
After you.
For some reason the microphone didn't work earlier.
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than to get permission.
How do you explain it?
I hate that idea.
Is everything all right at home?

I just wanted to go jogging.
Why don't you stick around for a few minutes?
When is good for you?
He wanted to meet you.
I've always wanted to learn to cook like you.
How do I get to the airport?
I am sorry to have troubled you.
He doesn't have the capacity to be president.
I know Tom will be cooperative.
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria.
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
I don't know how to reach you.
I was quite surprised.
It rained five successive days.
Why don't you give me a break?
I wrote the note.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
A man's worth lies in what he is rather than what he has.
Nobody knows about the plan.
He found the door closed.
I think you did it.
I met him on my way home.
I don't want to step on your toes.

Can you give me an example?

I did that which she asked me to do.
I just got your letter yesterday.
He is a good doctor.

Are you certain about this?
How did they get in here?
What is it you really want to tell me?
Let's talk about your family.
The man ate bread.
Are these your children?
Tom had many friends.
You must teach me what you know.

I'd rather not eat the same food again today.
Tom is a good friend.
I'm waiting for my driver.
I washed my hands with soap and water.
Everyone said that I was wrong.
I'm beautiful.
Tom likes learning French.
I know your mom doesn't want you to talk to me.
Give me a minute, would you?
I went to see the movies yesterday.
Tom isn't strong.
I don't take any medication.
I hope everything is okay.
Did you get the loan?
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
I haven't seen him since then.
I have a new job.
This is an apple, too.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
On my way home, I came across an old friend.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
That shouldn't be hard for you.
Do you ever study in the library?
She's pleased with her new dress.
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
I'm sure Tom can win.
Some people go to church on Sunday morning.
Last night, I was so tired that I fell asleep with the TV on.

You're awesome.
You're really gifted.
You're fortunate.
Why are you so quiet?
He likes to watch TV.
A childhood illness left her blind.
What would life be without hope?
Tom didn't give me any alternative.
No matter what happens, I won't be surprised.
We're looking for somebody who can use a computer.
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
I can't trust you anymore.
I don't know if we're going to make it on time.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
The teacher omitted the exercise on page 21 of the book.
She heard him sing.
I ought to have consulted my parents on the matter.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I got shampoo in my eyes and it hurts.
You must pay attention to his advice.
Do you know the answer?

Take your seats, please.

It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
You had better prepare for the future.
We're very excited about that.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
Is this jasmine tea?
How can this be possible?
Show me your hand.
After a bit of googling, I suspect that what you said may not be true.
That house is small, but it's big enough for us.
We were partners.
Tom enjoys reading books.
Do you know where he bought his camera?
I'm afraid I've offended you.
Why do we have to take it away?
He was about to fall asleep, when he heard his name called.
Would you sing for me?
Tom put on a coat.
Can you tell us how that'll work?
I'd like to hear you sing.
Will you help them?
She will write another book one of these days.

I think I can do that.

I don't see how that is any of your business.
You're not bad.
I didn't think anything of it.
I have a clear memory of my childhood.
She demanded to see the manager.
He slammed the door right in my face.
How would you like your steak done?
You scare me.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Tom is not religious.
He will look after the cats for me while I'm abroad.
What medications are you taking?
Where did all this come from?
I lost my wedding ring.
I asked Tom not to tell Mary about that, but he did anyway.
Stay here with us.
I was told that I needed to get enough sleep.
That job wasn't very interesting. However, the pay was good.
I'll be right there.
I burned the paper.
Tom and Mary won't go without me.

You heard correctly.

There are more cars on the road in the summer than in the winter.
There are lots of things to do.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
I've remarried.
You've found it.
As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand.
I hope Tom's predictions are wrong.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
He is accustomed to the work.
I am on holiday this week.
I'll trust you.
We went into the red last year.
You're too trusting.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
How big you are!
Tom declined my invitation.
I feel very confident.
I bought every book on Japan I could find.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
Tom has a thick beard.
You have only to ask for it.
I appreciate your vigilance.

It's self-explanatory.
I hope you're not alone.
It's kind of a bad time.
Don't let go of the rope.
I broke up with her.
The cup is full.
You're too old for me.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
I informed her of my success.
Would you mind if I changed seats now?
A passport is usually necessary when you travel overseas.
She asserted that she was right.
It is difficult to satisfy everyone.
Do you have something to do with that company?
What has he done to you?
I work out to stay in shape.
What was the first concert you went to?
No one was at home.
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
Get to bed.
Please tell me.
Can you translate this manuscript from French to English?
I want my hammer back.
You said you were busy.
Write an essay on "Friendship".
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
Did I just do that?
I should've warned you.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
I'll call you at noon.
The clerk waited on them immediately.
Do you have an interpreter?
I'd like a beer.
Moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing.
Grab that.

I can't figure out how to upload an image.
Today is Tuesday.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
I finally understand what you were trying to tell me.
They were not listening to music.
What in the world are you doing?
You should have told it to me sooner.
Will you show me the book?
I'm glad that's over.
Tom found me a taxi.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

At the end of a working day, everybody is in a hurry to get home.
You can take it.
Do you still love him?
I sat on the couch.
Both were extremely rich.
That's just what I need.
That's a wise choice.
Tom's coming.
I should have gone to bed earlier last night.
Could you pass me the salt, please?
I'm free.
I usually don't bother with people like him.
This is relaxing.
I want to know what time to come.
It'll be hot.
Those two are exactly alike.
Tom is a professional killer.
He was raging mad.
Are you really as old as you say you are?
Tom kept on crying.
I've been all over Europe.
That's kind of you to say.
Tom and Mary got into an argument.
I think I have an idea.
My friend says that she's suicidal.

He died from overwork.
She's a real hottie.
I want you to promise me something.
The boy caught a large fish.
Your answer is wrong.
We agreed among ourselves.
It's a huge responsibility.
Do you know who this car here belongs to?
I didn't know you wanted to work for me.
I am just a humble teacher.
Can I have one?
Maybe I went a little too far.
How did you learn about that news?
You obviously don't have time.
I can't save you.
Tom took out his cell phone so that he could take a selfie.
You don't have to go.
Please leave your message on my answering machine.
I have forgotten.
May I introduce myself to you?
I'm homesick.
I just couldn't stay away.
I like your place.
My house has a small yard.
Insects are arthropods.
I bought a pair of scissors.
I can't stop thinking about Tom.
We're competitors, not partners.
She used to enjoy being with him.
Let me get you some ice.
She was all smiles.
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
Can you do it faster?
Tom told me he was determined to do that.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
It's still my birthday.
My father is in.
Are you having dinner?
It's nothing short of a miracle.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
I have to do it myself.
They often make fun of the boss.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
Which group is your friend in?
Are you crazy?
You're wiser than you know.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
He attained his goal.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
Let me pay for your coffee.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
I meant no harm.
He fainted in the middle of his speech.
I want to catch the 11:45.

I'd like for you to leave.
Tom speaks Japanese better than Japanese do.
I wanted to say hello to Tom.
How did you know what I was thinking?
You can go home.
That's exactly how I want it.
I hope the weather will be fine tomorrow.
Who taught you French?
Everything was better in the past.
I got confused.
I'm glad that Tom is here.
I don't think we have a choice.
He lost his eyesight.
Take no prisoners.
What a great idea!
Just leave me alone.
You're nuts!
Don't try too hard!
He has a bookstore in the center of the city.
Are you the group leader?
Do you remember?
It takes a thief to catch a thief.
The peace talks failed once again.
I try to keep a low profile.
You shouldn't read in such poor light.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
Please make yourself at home.
Who was it that bought this skirt yesterday?
He shook his son by the shoulder.
I would like to eat there.
I couldn't go to work because I was sick.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
Are you ready to fly?
I got busy.
Will she forgive him for forgetting her birthday?
Well, what did you find out?
I just did what the boss asked me to do.
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
Mary loves shoes with high heels.
Your team is better than ours.
I expect that he will help us.
Most of these are mine.
I often drink tea.
I said exactly what they wanted to hear.
Rain is forecast for this evening.
Tom is usually at home on Sundays.
Will you try this on for me?
I have only one pen.
I want to go out with you.
He wants to marry my daughter.
He is now in a very difficult situation.
Show yourself.
It's been a long time since I last spoke French.
Have you been smoking?
You look upset.
I'm afraid I don't follow.
You have made the very same mistake again.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
Speak a little louder.
Who owns this ship?
I'm beginning to see what you mean.
Having finished lunch, we went skating.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
I know the photographer who took this picture.
I was very tired, but I was nevertheless unable to sleep.
They rely on the foodbank.
In case of an emergency, dial 110.
I can't leave now.
What has he done to you?
We're stalled.
I am an American.
Things took a sudden turn for the worse.
We're not eating.
That's great!
The coat is not mine.
Do you know something I don't know?
Hold still.
I wish you hadn't found me.
Please spend a few minutes thinking about this.
A housewife should be economical.
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
You're a romantic.
He grew up in a small town.
You're joking, of course.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in a hurry.
Would you go to your room?
Who else do you miss?
I want you to be a bridesmaid.
Did you take it?
I really enjoyed last night.
Quit acting like a child.
She seems to have something to do with the affair.
I bought that car.
That's what I expected it to be like.
Tom should let Mary know that he likes her.
You should be more careful the next time.
Few people know how to do it.
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
No minors allowed.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
I was ushered to my seat.
You won't need that.
They're not coming.
How many plates do you want?
I'm not dying.
Be discreet.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I waited a whole year for that.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
Don't try to make me angry.
Forget I said that.
You can't do anything right, can you?
He made up his mind right away.
Pleased to meet you.
The lamb was cooked perfectly.
There is no wine in that bottle.
I had to give it a try.
He was wounded in the battle.
She sent him a postcard.
I'm not sure he wants to talk to me.
He became the company president when he was thirty.
I don't have the number.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
My house is tiny.
That's how I came to know her.
A book can be compared to a friend.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Tom won't answer the question.
How long have you been living on Park Street?
He won a gold medal.
Nobody likes being laughed at.
He smiled and left.
I hate long flights.
Are you a student?
I love your sweater.
You said you were going to handle it.
You should've stayed in Boston.
I thought we were going to die.
This is not natural.
Last night someone broke into the small shop near my house.
There was a lot of snow last year.
I am in charge of the third-year class.
I don't want to throw that away.
Why don't we settle the matter once and for all?
Did you put on some sunscreen?
I caught them in the act.
Keep that thing away from me.
He's your friend.
Which program did you watch yesterday?
How many people were there?
I have a bruise.
Tom was in Boston that year.
It was very painful.
I'm really not interested in history.
Are you sure?
This is my beer.
I never agree with him.
She says she's not dating anyone now, but I don't believe her.
You were almost in time.
I like being part of this group.
How did you become involved in this project?
Please wait five minutes.
I don't like the smell of garlic.
What happens if I press this button?
Let's go!
How do you remember that?
Tom will be arriving any moment.
We are going to travel by car.
I don't feel like playing either.
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
He is busy learning English.
She betrayed you.
"Will you show me your ticket?" "Yes, of course."
I hope that it'll work.
I don't think we should buy this.
As far as I know, he is not married.
The new model will retail for 30,000 yen.
Don't make the same mistake again.
When did you visit your friends?
They saved us.
I wasn't informed of this.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
He's a smooth talker.
They don't talk at all.
Why don't you tell me what to do?
I let the cat out of the house.
She plays the violin well.
Assuming your story is true, what should I do?
I loved to climb trees when I was a kid.
Tom died on Monday in Boston.
That's a beautiful name.
Apparently, not much has changed.
I miss my parents.
How lucky you are!
You didn't come here alone, did you?
His debts were piling up.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
The only thing I want to do right now is sleep.
My sister works as a secretary at a bank.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
We use a lot of water every day.
Tom isn't the only one here that can speak French.
There is not much I can do to help, I am afraid.
Tom wasn't violent.
Where would you want to live?
Is that really what Tom said?
Please lower the window.
Did you read it all?
It was a big one.
I thought I'd prefer going by myself.
It was here that I saw her.
I didn't ask.
I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say.
We would like to stay here tonight.
She refused to accept the money.
What he said turned out to be true.
It is said that he was very rich.
Tom can reach me at this number any time of day.
I would like to visit New York someday.
He earns his living by writing.
He's allergic to cats.
If I were a bird, I could fly to you.
We can't afford this.
Shouldn't you be at school now?
It was quite funny.
I just wanted to say thank you for all your help.
What is the exchange rate?
I don't want your money.
I'll protect her with my life.
Tom has lived in Boston for three years.
Do you have enough blankets?
How can I extract the audio from a video clip?
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
This is funny.
I played the flute.
Let me know what you want to do.
You've been had.
Where was he headed?
I could've married Tom.

We'll never know who he is.
Please leave this room.
I passed the test with flying colors.
This book is full of errors.
I don't like the way she speaks to me.
He did not speak at all.
Tom does that a lot better than I do.

Send him in.
What's your favorite subject?

I feel flattered.
How's your new apartment?
She is not afraid of anything.
Who do you trust?

I awoke from a long dream.
Can this possibly be the right address?
I prefer this version.
I guess I felt like eating something different.
We're changing it.
Things are different here.
Tom isn't rude, but Mary is.
Keep your eyes peeled!
I wore a white shirt.
Everyone suddenly burst into laughter.

Tom got killed in an automobile accident.
They don't understand me when I speak German.
This is where I brought my girlfriend on our first date.
Which one is broken?
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
He is suspected of robbery.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
I think Tom is illiterate.
He hurried up so that he wouldn't miss the train.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
I never received the money.
Have you ever been a teacher?
Your troubles are just beginning.
I feel very relaxed.
We can't help you with that.
The room smelled of tobacco.
Her father never let her go to town with her friends.
It's my CD.
I don't want to do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Tom said he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive.
Are you at work?
Don't you just love a mystery?
Be more flexible.
Last year saw a big political change in Japan.
I don't have to listen to you.
We're pretty confident.
I knew what was going to happen.
Tom found my bicycle.
The eagle is about to land.
Let's shake hands.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
Is that gun loaded?
Tom had some very unusual experiences.
I would like to go to Russia sometime.
My father has been in good shape since his operation.
I doubt that's what really happened.
It's for you.
You look very good in blue.
We need a tool to open it with.
He's getting more and more stubborn with age.
She reminded him to go to the bank.
Who did you meet?
The decision whether I should see her is mine alone.
He was not happy about it.
It is too good to be true.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
I envy you.
He speaks French as well as English.
Brush your teeth.
They said you were fired.
I helped my father yesterday.
I hope you were able to buy everything you need.
I remember returning the book to the library.
My dictionary is very useful.
How was your summer?
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing.
Tom and Mary discovered something amazing.
It was a great shock to me.
You've got a pretty good memory.
This room is for rent.
He asked her to marry him and she accepted his proposal.
The meeting was just about over.
I wonder what language they speak in Brazil.
You still have a lot to learn about women.
I'll cut your head off!
Get Tom to help you.
Do you want me to tell you why?
Tom is a 33-year-old man.
My sister is always weighing herself.
I lost the camera I had bought the day before.
Let's share this money.
They're staying.
We are changing our clothes.
My sister is bugging me.
You should tell Tom what to do.
I like beer.
Are you doing anything tomorrow night?
This heat is unbearable.
I'll be back before you know it.
You don't have to lie.
The price is three hundred dollars.
I thought you were in charge.
Cherry blossoms are very beautiful.
This soup tastes really great.
Tom and Mary got into their car.
France is in western Europe.
Do you have a better idea?
I can't believe you're here.
I never make a speech without being nervous.
It's all white.
I don't want to have kids, and I don't want to get married.
You're out of order.
Tom ran out of the room.
Look before you leap.
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.
Tom knows that won't work.
Do you speak English?
She sat next to him wishing she were somewhere else.
He took off his hat.
Get out of my bed.
I'm not sleepy.
This newspaper is free.
I think Tom is going to call you.
I love the way you kiss.
What are you going to do with it?
Give it to me.
I have a slight headache now.
Can't you speak French?
Times are tough.
Here's the bill.
Isn't one of you enough?
It's kind of late.
I want to be in your life again.
That'll be enough.
I remember that feeling.
One of the boys suddenly ran away.
The roof is on fire.
Life is full of surprises.
Tom is a very strange person.
Keep the child away from the pond.
Did you get all that?
I can replace it.
She asked me to help her with the work.
I had never seen such a beautiful girl before.
I want to do this as much as you do.
I thought you were asleep.
That plane will take off at five.
I was overconfident.
Would you mind leaving us alone?
I love the smell of freshly baked bread.
I've never done it like that before.
You might want to try working out a bit.
Tom's reaction was the opposite of what Mary had expected.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Where are you going to vacation this summer?
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
Dinner was awesome.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
My neighbor is crazy.
Tom shook my hand.
Do you know who that person is?
He speaks Russian perfectly.
Can I share something important with you?
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Tom died in 2003.
I want some milk.
I didn't really believe it.
The coach gave me some advice.
I look forward to watching you dance.
I'll make some coffee.
Tom is very jealous.
What do you do to stay in shape?
If you can, come with us.
Tom said that he couldn't sleep at all last night.
You should eat vegetables.
A huge tanker just pulled out from the dock.
How does that make you feel?
I have small hands.
We're both right.
Hurry up, guys.
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
We tried to cheer him up.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
I don't mind helping you clean up after the party.
It looks like you're trying to grow a beard.
I was happy to hear the news.
Please forgive me for being late.
I am very surprised that she became a Diet member.
Do you think it's my fault?
He took my umbrella without so much as asking.
If you don't miss the train, you'll get there in time.
I always knew this could happen.
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
The room was empty.
Dr. Smith has a lot of patients.
I left my hat on the plane.
You might be interested in this.
Do you like French wines?
His teeth were white.
You really should try this cake.
I need to know if you are planning to come.
It was no laughing matter.
I have to finish the work by four o'clock.
I don't know his address.
They forgot to lock the door.
Are you really that stupid?
Tom didn't really feel like going out drinking with the guys.
We want a new carpet.
Everybody's in a hurry these days.
Tom is packing.
I don't want to visit Tom.
She gave him all of her money.
We have to get something to eat.
A home is more than a mere building.
He thought it was hilarious.
Do you know where it is?
He is every inch a gentleman.
She became a singer.
He asked for a beer.
There were many things that needed my attention, so I didn't get home until after midnight.
Do I look dead to you?
I'll water the garden.
We have a good group of volunteers.
He appealed to us for help.
A scream broke the silence.
They're all hungry.
I prefer to work at night.
I need help now.
I just thought you were happy.
I want to hear this.
I'm fed up with English.
Tom persuaded Mary to go to the party with him.
Can anyone translate this sentence?
My parents live in the country.
Get into the car.
Just do your job.
He helped an old lady get up from her seat.
Not all children like apples.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
You can smoke in this room.
I filled the bucket with water.
The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry.
Pork doesn't agree with me.
I love all of you.
How long have you been working here?
If you have something to say, say it now or pipe down.
He got dressed and went outside.
He's thrilled with his new job.
They don't want the truth.
I wanted to help, but I couldn't do anything.
He is always reading.
Don't sass me.
Maybe that's the reason.
Tom wasn't allowed to see his father.
He may have told a lie.
Where were you on 9/11?
You look like your dad.
I've gotten used to this climate.
You're cuter than Mary.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
My father drives very well.
I'll miss you very much if you go.
They took a big risk.
Don't buy me any more presents.
He let me use his typewriter.
Do you like Mozart's music?
Help yourself to the cake.
I want to take you to lunch.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
You cannot heal a broken heart.
You should apologize.
I've figured out the puzzle.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
Be careful.
I had to change the plan.
I can't just stay here.
Her bicycle is blue.
It's not why I'm here.
Don't walk out on me again.
The pain was almost unbearable.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
I think you deserve this.
Nobody is too old to learn.
I was wrong.
I never wanted to harm you.
Tom is persuaded he's right.
You make me sick.
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
Do you do this often?
There was a sudden change in the situation.
You don't deserve to live.
Tom is older than Mary.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
His wish was to go to America.
Cut that out!
I wonder whether I could help Tom.
I didn't mean to spook you.
Kyoto gets lots of visitors from all over the world.
Tom is in the living room.
Sometimes, you must fail before you succeed.
I was just trying to be helpful.
Nobody would listen to me.
When I was your age, I had a boyfriend.
Could you cook this meat a little more?
They fed a black and a white dog.
You really annoy me.
I'm running out of ideas.
The feeling was mutual.
I had a seizure.
Can you keep a secret?
You're always saying that.
I'm certainly not your friend.
The girl trembled with fear.
She was burning with anger.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
A man came up to me and asked for a match.
The bell has not rung yet.
Is Tom safe?
Who do you think you are?
A drunk driver was responsible for the car accident.
Tom should do as Mary suggests.
Where did you learn to dance like this?
You're not alone.
I have an urgent matter to attend to.
The moon is behind the clouds.
Are you still on a diet?
Those children are cheerful.
Tom listens.
Have you ever seen a tiger around here?
She killed him with a knife.
Leave our house.
It was heart-warming.
I will never forgive you.
May I talk to you for a second?
I'm not going to show you this.
My cousin isn't the kind of person who'd ever break a promise.
You should eat more.
I was dismissed.
There'll be a problem.
I've had a very busy morning.
I can't find the right man for me.
The complaint is under investigation.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Language changes as human beings do.
We have lost a battle, but we will win the war.
In my opinion, he's right.
Why would you want to do something like that?
Are you still in the job?
At the moment, I have a pretty good job.
Tom's situation is different.
Even though the accident was six months ago, my neck still hurts.
I bought a few eggs and a little milk.
He was cheating.
Why am I still here?
He was blue from the cold.
What are we waiting for?
There are five fish in my aquarium.
The company abandoned that project.
My friend helped me.
That's kind of you to say.
What else do you want to do?
We'll be there in plenty of time.
I no longer believe anything you say.
I'm jealous.
He's very young. He's much younger than Tom.
Tom didn't like that place.
I'm going back.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Let me explain this.
Do you drink wine?
I don't need to write it down.
Tom saw that movie last summer.
Tom didn't know what Mary's last name was.
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?
That was only a year ago.
Did you agree to do it?
As far as I know, he won't come.
No matter how capable you are, you're not going to get a promotion.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
We have to solve this problem.
Would you like a little more salad?
I can't imagine what you're going through.
Aren't you at least curious?
I know every inch of the town.
We're nearly out of time.
No, you can't.
You're beautiful.
Give Tom back his money.
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Are you still sleepy?
Are you telling me the truth?
I can't thank you enough for all your kindness.
You are bound to fail unless you study harder.
He participated in the debate.
Come on! I can't wait any more.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
What's the most fun you've ever had?
Her hair is long.
Are you looking for somebody?
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
The weather stayed bad.
You don't seem tired at all.
There's really nothing else to say.
I thought I'd never hear that.
I met a friend of mine at the airport.
I was lost.
I know Tom is smart.
Give me something to drink.
Why don't we take some time to think about it?
I need to find somebody who can babysit on Friday nights.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
Are you home?
I bared my soul to her.
He doesn't want me to go, but I mean to.
He lives at the top of the hill.
I knew you weren't really dead.
We got lucky.
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
There's a problem.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Go.
Why do you really want to lose weight?
You don't seem so busy.
Did you get a good look at his face?
I think he's tired.
As far as I know, he has never come on time.
It seems interesting.
Are you sure you're up for it?
Tom drinks a lot.
We weren't able to determine her whereabouts.
Wind the clock.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
I wanted your cooperation.
I don't think many people can say they are satisfied with their salary.
We can't begin the meeting until we have a quorum.
How did I get here?
How much money do you have?
He's three years older than her.
May I visit you tomorrow?
I am fed up with this wet weather.
I must confess that my theory doesn't account for that fact.
I'm too sleepy to drive.
The outdoor concert was canceled due to the storm.
The dog was dead.
Would you like to join us for dinner?
Why is it that you are always late?
I didn't see anything strange.
I'm trying to save money.
Let's take care of business.
Do you look up to your parents?
Try to get a good night's sleep.
Why are you so busy?
I thought you were injured.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I wonder if my efforts will pay off.
I'd have waited for you.
I'll never forgive myself.
How did you learn to cook so well?
I'm retired, too.
I had him wash the car.
Spanish is spoken in Mexico.
What do you like?
Isn't that irritating?
Tom is John's twin.
Did you get in trouble with your parents?
The lost boy was identified by his clothes.
I hate eating alone.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
How did you think it would go?
I'm going to go sit in my car.
I've been laid off.
Tom doesn't think he could do that.
I'm waiting for your help.
Tom is dating an exchange student from China.
One can't live without water.
What do you suppose is in this box?
Would you like to be rich?
I was too afraid to do anything.
Many schools are closed today because of the storm.
They're treating me like a child.
You may park here.
I owe you a dinner.
How much is your hourly pay?
Laughing is really good for you.
That's all I know for sure.
There's a party going on in the next room.
Tom and Mary know each other well.
I hate silent movies.
They let her marry him.
I ate too much today.
They need food and water.
Why did you change your mind?
They were motivated by revenge.
They want to do this right.
You should keep this machine clean and lubed.
It seemed like a good idea.
There must be a better way to do this.
I'm saving money for a car.
This won't be the last time.
You're not too late.
I beg your pardon?
The balloon is filled with air.
He drank a shot of whiskey.
The two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
They want to do this right.
I hate to put you through this.
I mean you no harm.
He is able to swim like a fish.
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.
Is that your girlfriend?
Pick a number.
It took all day.
You didn't drink that water, did you?
It's not as easy as you think.
How many people do you think we should invite to our party?
Forget I said anything.
I want these people out of here.
The climate of New Zealand is similar to that of Japan.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I promise you I'll never leave you.
Can you do that for me?
He differs from me in some ways.
They teased the new student.
How much is the annual membership fee?
Stay awake.
If he had been honest, I would have employed him.
He was standing.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
Who is your mother?
Autumn is here.
You're the leader.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
I just panicked.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
Their muscles are stiff.
Tom and Mary took a selfie together.
Try to remain calm.
The escaped prisoners are still on the run.
Tom looked a little frightened.
May I see you in private?
I don't feel like working today.
I contributed.
I can prove it to you.
He spoke highly of you.
I did find something.
Are you still afraid?
He tried to put the blame on me.
All the flowers in the garden died for lack of water.
He does this all the time.
How long are they?
I met him just as he was coming out of school.
How do you think it made me feel?
I wish you'd never been born.
How many hours a day does Tom swim?
I was going to run over the notes one last time, but there wasn't time.
Tom certainly didn't expect to win.
They climbed down the tree.
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
We have to be prepared to cope with violent storms.
I'm sleepy because I stayed up all night studying for a test.
This is simply amazing.
No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked against us.
Why would I want to sue you?
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
He left the box unprotected.
I think we should head back.
You don't sound too sure.
Many children at this school are malnourished.
I have little interest in history.
He will take over the business when his father retires.
He has a lot more money than I have.
Americans like football in the same way that Japanese like baseball.
I read the report you wrote.
Keep your hands off me.
You have a good job.
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for help.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
I want them all shot.
Did I tell you that already?
I have a serious skin problem.
I'm left-handed.
You might want to try it sometime.
The man is eating bread.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
He let me go.
What was your relationship with your father like when you were a kid?
Do I annoy you?
I'm telling you the truth.
I suspected he was a liar.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Tom could've done much better.
We went to the video store.
I've been looking forward to meeting you again.
Prices have reached a 13-year high.
Wax the floor.
He also speaks French.
We are not here to arrest you.
He finished his dinner because he didn't like to waste food.
You're creative.
They said you were fired.
I fall asleep easily while watching television.
I need a map.
They saw little need for labor unions.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
What have you eaten today?
There's nothing wrong with this bicycle.
I'm by your side.
Tom left his trumpet at school.
We're alone.
I should probably not have done that.
He took over his father's business.
She aimed at the target.
Are you sure?
You don't think I can do it, do you?
Do I need to transfer?
The ceremony was impressive.
Nothing will take me away from you.
My mother didn't mention it.
Take your time.
Let me help.
He may not be happy.
I'm sneaky.
The population of China is 8 times that of Japan.
In case of an emergency, call the police.
They're in the shower.
He didn't attend the meeting.
There is little time left.
This would be a mistake.
I don't trust you.
The bed was too hard.
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
It was a beautiful sunny day.
I can't stop Tom.
Can you at least pretend you're enjoying yourself?
I'm not a violent person.
Look! Two boys are fighting.
Are you guys stupid or something?
Are you happy right now?
These are marshmallows.
The first casualty of every war is the truth.
That is what this is about.
This book is much more interesting than that one.
Tom gave me this watch.
This water is delicious.
I like them all.
We have to sing at an old folks home today.
The hours are terrible.
They admired the lovely scenery.
What's your diagnosis?
Don't fire anyone.
I need you to check on something.
Where is the closest pharmacy?
You're nuts!
That book is written in French.
The policeman said that it looked like a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
I know that things haven't been easy for you.
They entered into a heated discussion.
You seem upset.
Parallel lines do not intersect each other.
I shouldn't have eaten the whole bag of potato chips.
They'll get out of class in forty minutes.
This time, you've gone too far.
I have nothing particular to do.
I'm going to relax.
I've heard that some people sleep in bathtubs.
I'd prefer a window seat.
We all need to stay together.
Can you identify them?
The wind blew hard.
Let's spend less time arguing and more time working.
Have you been up all night?
What does your spouse like to do that you don't like to do?
Someone took my stuff.
Could you pass the salt?
He has no hope of getting ahead.
All the villagers know of the accident.
That will cost you a lot of money.
He sold his business and retired.
Something happened.
It's going really well.
We're not really friends anymore.
I don't understand what's happening.
Why am I crying?
Tom should learn French.
We all have kids.
Don't let him do it alone.
Tom can't do the job.
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
She stole my clothes!
Have they spotted you?
Why don't you stay a while?
There's no danger.
Clean your room.
Six o'clock will suit me very well.
Tom wants to come with us.
We've got to get help.
It's very easy to sound natural in your own native language, and very easy to sound unnatural in your non-native language.
The days are growing longer.
You can do it any way you like.
Were you obedient?
The castle might be haunted.
After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog.
He sometimes loses hope.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
I like music very much.
First of all, you have to read this book.
Where have you been all week?
The problem isn't that.
I needed your help on something, but I couldn't find you.
Have a nice flight.
I think Tom did that intentionally.
I love your daughter.
I'm far from happy about this situation.
Tom has willingly done everything we've asked him to do.
Would you like to come over to my place?
Flip a coin.
Teenagers often argue with their parents.
None of us are cowards.
I won't keep you too long.
Can you verify that this message came from Tom?
You need to pay extra for the batteries.
He changed the topic of conversation.
That's disturbing.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
You should not despise a man because he is poor.
I swear to you I will never do it again.
I told you that was just a joke.
We're all crazy.
What're we waiting for?
High tide is at 3 p.m. today.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
Nobody wants to work with you.
What are you sitting on?
Tom obeyed.
That's all there is.
I want a raise.
Get out of the classroom.
Can you forget your native language?
Picasso painted this picture in 1950.
I never want to leave you again.
The game will be held even if it rains.
We're the same.
His obscene remarks will be expunged from the record.
He doesn't like coffee.
I don't want to swim.
Put it back where you found it.
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
I'll shoot both of you.
You can't come with us.
Please close the door.
No one lives here.
Don't look so suspicious.
I guess that would be all right.
Let's be honest with each other.
You can easily find the bank.
Physics is my weak subject.
We were all present at her wedding.
I was not sure what to do.
He wants that a lot.
He's always complaining about something.
I was given a nice watch by my uncle.
Have a good weekend.
I want to get to know you.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
Has he failed again?
Please fasten your seat belt.
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor's house?
I thought that was obvious.
Will you sing some English songs for us?
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
I don't feel like eating.
What kind of work will you do?
Tom denied any guilt.
She went to see him reluctantly.
How did you get out of your room?
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.
How many computers have you had so far?
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
I think you can handle it.
He had no memory of the accident.
I told you it was dangerous.
I'm not advocating that.
You were great.
There is a military base near here.
I've come here to help you.
What happened to my bag?
What did you throw into the fire?
Do you have anything in mind?
Did you think of that?
I'm kidding.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
This is a pun.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
There were only six people at the meeting.
The bad weather delayed the plane for two hours.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
She scolded him for being late.
She said she had been happy.
I noticed him sitting with his back against the wall.
Tom wouldn't really do that, would he?
How can we prevent that from happening?
I party too much.
How many times a week do you eat out?
I can't stand that noise any longer.
He is in the bathroom.
Tom and Mary agreed on a price.
It's just an expression.
I've always considered you a close friend.
When the bomb exploded, I happened to be there.
Can you spell it?
It is our duty to obey the law.
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
Mars is a planet.
Please don't tell my wife.
I live in Tokyo.
There's no way to escape.
No one welcomed the proposal.
Are you having a good time?
Seeing me, the baby began to cry.
Haven't you ever kissed a girl?
You make it look easy.
Let's take a rest for a while.
The service agent helped me solve my problem.
So what do you suggest?
I'm cooking.
I ignored him.
I don't approve of your going out with him.
I feel very strongly about that.
Every religion prohibits murder.
I really misjudged you.
Was this your idea?
It's a nice country to visit, but I wouldn't live there.
Tom stole Mary's phone and took a bunch of selfies before sneaking it back into her purse.
Be nicer to your brother.
I can't wait for tomorrow to come.
Are you here with anyone?
You should bone up on your French before your trip to Marseille.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this song became a hit.
Several politicians exerted strong pressure on the committee.
You should work hard.
I was at work.
We're sorry.
Have they arrived yet?
I do not like science.
He arrived earlier than usual.
Tom doesn't like living alone.
Don't forget.
Did I just say something stupid?
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
You're a hundred percent right.
I love to go to the movies.
Why are we still talking about this?
Didn't you hear her speaking French?
I want to get rid of it.
I went home.
Stay here and wait for her.
I just got out of jail.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
The price reflects the demand.
I thought perhaps you'd give up.
I don't want to see it.
Is something happening?
I'm going to the police station.
This hall was full of people.
I laughed out loud.
Tom will probably wait for you.
You do not want to incur the wrath of God.
I'm much older than you are.
I learned to milk a cow.
I have an old bicycle.
Tom came into the house.
In a sense, life is only a dream.
I'm glad you're OK again.
What can I do for you?
I'd never do what Tom did.
You're not alone anymore.
That's my suitcase.
Both of my parents have passed away.
I've finally gotten over my cold.
My father loves my mother.
The more stubborn you are, the more isolated you become.
We enjoyed watching the fireworks on a bridge last summer.
That ball could've hit me.
That's what I was told three hours ago.
She resides in New York.
We saw nothing strange.
The old couple gave him up for lost.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
Why are you so happy?
We're the same.
That is surprising.
How does that make you feel?
This isn't a safe place.
I haven't done that very many times yet.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
How long do I have to wait?
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
Her husband smokes like a chimney.
No one's going to save you now.
I'm focusing on my job.
Where's the closest train station?
I'll not be at home next Sunday.
I wish to be alone for a while.
Have a look.
Don't let me down like you did the other day.
How do you feel about the proposed changes?
Did you enjoy the tour?
Run for it!
The house requires repairs.
The company wants to hire 20 people.
Where is the station?
I'm dependable.
Please ask someone else.
Tom lit the candle that was on the table.
The fight lasted three seconds.
I'm sober.
The Normans conquered England in 1066.
I missed school for six days.
All you have to do is to wait.
Does that make you feel better?
It's an excellent method to relieve stress.
My baby has a hereditary disease.
Why are you really doing this?
I looked for a place to crash.
She divorced her husband.
You're the scapegoat.
You have to get up.
I'm decorating the classroom.
I'm really glad I ran into you.
I'm happy with what I've got.
It should only take a couple of minutes.
I can't bear to work with him.
I don't think that she will come.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
Let's cross the street.
Please light a candle.
Some of these are mine.
Thanks very much for doing this.
I think perhaps you're right.
Is it true that you can't swim?
I only need a minute.
I can do it all myself.
Will you come with me to the concert?
You don't speak English, do you?
I'm a little thirsty.
Tom has pleaded not guilty.
At what time did the show finish?
I want to do it for you.
I've hired an attorney.
My toe started bleeding.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
She can handle it.
Tom and Mary got married secretly.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
He turned out to be innocent.
This neighborhood is very scary.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
We were mistaken.
We'll go to Hong Kong first, and then we'll go to Singapore.
Where do you think we came from?
Nothing happened between us.
I need a hacksaw to finish this job.
Have you ever smoked?
I just wanted to listen to some music.
Can I see this one?
I won't stay here alone.
All passengers are required to show their tickets.
When did your friend leave for America?
Tom is wiser than I am.
Are these all the same?
Tom thinks it's stupid.
He likes that video game very much.
She didn't want him to play poker.
Do I look fat?
I'm flabbergasted.
Garlic enhances the flavor of meals.
There's nothing more I can do.
We went to see our neighbors.
I had difficulty convincing her of the dangers of smoking.
No one would've listened.
What a hypocrite!
Could I get some tea?
I want to study English.
I'm just waiting for a friend.
You don't understand.
Does this ring a bell?
Tom has shoulder-length hair dyed red.
Did Tom buy it?
The girls are going to be late this evening.
I'd like to come with you.
Get a job.
Tom prepared a healthy meal for Mary.
I just want to be a little happier.
Does Tom eat eggs?
Where was your daughter?
Being very tired, I soon fell asleep.
I crossed the river by boat.
Please tell me what happened.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
He can't speak English.
It's always been that way.
I was naive.
Will you light the fire?
I'm sorry, but I can't lend you my car next weekend.
I can teach you how to fish.
Who were you looking for?
I was born the same day as my dog.
Remember to mail the letter on your way to school.
I was relaxed.
He measured the length of the bed.
Don't hurt me.
I was happy to help you.
I'm really happy for you.
I don't have a badge.
Leave me alone.
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
What is your name, sir?
I brought dinner.
Tom will take a look at it.
That's enough for today.
Can someone help me, please?
Did you carry out your plan?
I put my clothes in the dryer.
Put your mask on.
Tom drank three bottles of wine by himself last night.
It is a song.
He needs you.
She quit her job last month.
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
You should go home early.
We were going steady.
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother.
She likes cooking for her family.
Who can prevent it?
She's good at tennis.
More and more Americans go abroad.
We saw her when leaving the house.
Not knowing what to do, he asked me for help.
Don't let Tom escape.
How is your family name written?
I must be going deaf.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
You're not good at this.
You're finicky.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
You've got three weeks.
You should have come earlier.
Can I take a selfie with you?
Your boyfriend looks cute.
I need to make an appointment.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Never forget to lock the door.
Please look at these papers carefully.
Tom deserves a better life.
She took the book back to the library.
I just don't believe you.
You don't want to be late for practice.
By the way, what's your address?
I had to see you again.
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
America is a country of immigrants.
That cake looks good.
You still have a lot to learn.
Tom didn't come today.
I cooked dinner.
She also likes chocolate.
I can't take my glasses off.
Tom's horse bit him.
We're headed in the right direction.
He is very angry.
The members of the committee are all men.
Watch my back.
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
Tom was my role model.
I just wanted Mary to love me.
You're no different.
The students must not enter the teachers' room this week.
That's the message.
Am I clear?
Do you come here a lot?
Today is a beautiful day.
Oh no!
We were startled by the explosion.
I don't see how you can ignore this.
You must do it quickly.
I'm not a very good singer.
They can't all be full.
You're a traitor.
They love their kids.
I cut myself with a hacksaw.
Don't cut in while we're talking.
I really liked what you cooked for me.
It is difficult to convey the meaning exactly.
Do you want to come sit by me?
You can swim, but I can't.
He's mumbling something.
I don't like eggs.
I cut myself.
I have to do it by myself.
How do I look tonight?
She left France for America.
Everyone's asleep.
Mary has a flower in her hand.
I told the children to be quiet, but they just kept on being noisy.
I'm not the only one who can do this.
Who could possibly believe this?
That reminds me of home.
Planning is important.
Please tell me your name.
A true scientist would not think like that.
Don't let him do it alone.
France used to have many colonies in Africa.
Whose house is this?
I didn't ask you to come here.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
This hurts more than you can imagine.
She eats nothing but vegetables.
Would you give me a break?
You need to be prepared.
Could somebody give us a hand?
You'll have a rough time.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
I'd like to look things over.
He caught hold of the rope.
Come with me.
Where did they go?
Tom has to follow our rules.
He denied everything.
When did you start writing songs?
I'm asking what you think.
He was sleeping under the tree.
The tree was felled with one hard blow of his ax.
I can't get that out of my mind.
You must work hard to succeed.
What will you do?
You won't be fired.
I'm getting little pimples on my face. I wonder if I've been getting enough sleep lately.
Tom shut his eyes.
I'm interested.
You're very stylish.
She stood as close to him as she could.
Reading develops the mind.
She first met him in Boston.
How long does it take to get to the station?
Why don't you take off your coat?
This book is mine. Where is yours?
I have to talk to Tom about what happened.
No one is coming with me.
She likes word games.
Tell me again how much money you have.
I wish you'd told me that a bit earlier.
I usually go home at four.
Tom was sitting at his desk.
You must be exhausted.
My friend gave me a silk scarf.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
I make it a rule to brush my teeth before I go to bed.
She looked him right in the eye.
Do you know how that feels?
What if someone sees this?
Don't worry. We'll figure everything out.
You won't succeed.
I'll tell you why.
Tom walked out of the meeting.
Our only daughter died of cancer.
Give me another example.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
Every year, many older people die in road accidents.
Take a break.
I can't do this myself.
You won't bleed to death.
We made friends with them.
We finally did it.
Why did you come here today?
Neither of those things happened.
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing.
No one was present.
Please write with a pen.
Your problems are similar to mine.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
Let's get out for a while to take a walk.
I bought the book yesterday.
I've had enough.
Would you like to hear more?
Let's not tell anybody.
I'm really happy for you.
Is that true?
I like to be thorough.
This is how it happened.
You can't fool me with a trick like that.
Don't look into the box.
We know you're not stupid.
I can't understand what you said at all.
Here's an example.
This hat is mine.
You may choose one of them.
I'll be praying for you.
You get paid in proportion to the amount of the work you do.
Who are you supposed to be?
You'd better go home.
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I can't figure this out.
Be prepared for the worst.
Don't put off those matters.
I know how busy you've been.
What do you do for fun?
There's someone waiting for me outside.
Tom is kidding.
I want to tell you the story.
What are the children doing in the garden?
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember how to do it.
If you don't know, who does?
I love butterflies.
I've never been abroad.
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I'm 100% sure of my decision.
Tom hung out with his friends last night.
I never imagined anything like this.
Tom suggested another plan to the committee.
I know that you are a teacher.
I know you have a girlfriend.
Today is September first.
I can't talk about that right now.
I'll be at Tom's.
You're quite safe.
I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly.
I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, we'd have been friends.
Tie your shoe.
We were in danger of losing our lives.
It's not mine.
You're not being rational.
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
I avoid going there late at night.
I prefer that dress to this one.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
May I pay by check?
They're boys.
She advised him to go home early.
You look like you saw a ghost.
I like English.
I think you owe me an explanation.
You don't have to come.
We have different ways of thinking.
The old man is angry and bitter.
I'm going to watch the baseball game tonight.
I thought he had died.
Get on your knees.
You can't have understood what he said.
Did we hit something?
Give me some milk.
I reviewed the file.
You should choose a job in relation to your talents and interests.
What do you want to be?
Meet me at 2:30.
I'm shaken.
He made up his mind to go there.
Did you volunteer us?
He came back two days later.
I just want you to know that I regret it.
Is that your name?
A white car has been tailing me for the last two miles.
Who's the girl in a yellow raincoat?
You'll go to school tomorrow.
Everything is under control.
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't swim?
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
He gave me a stern look.
Don't approach the dog.
I saw a cat running after the dog.
The clock is made in Switzerland.
Give him a break!
Do you really want to win?
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
It's not what you wear, it's how you wear it.
They don't know my name.
I'm just glad everything worked out.
I hope you'll join us.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
She didn't try to evade the truth.
We're serious.
It's terrible.
You're very attractive.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
This is all unnecessary.
I have been on friendly terms with him for more than twenty years.
He tried to restrain his anger.
Where did they learn this?
Something very strange is happening here.
I'm trying to talk to you.
We have guests.
I'd like to make a statement.
I'm going to be sick.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
I'm ashamed of my past.
I'm going to tell you the truth.
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?
What hotel will you be staying at?
The temperature is below zero today, too.
The accident happened before my very eyes.
Don't risk your fortune on that.
If I had enough money, I could buy this book.
We were both in the library.
Give me your money!
That's really funny.
Oil and water won't blend with each other.
Tom is drunk.
Don't you think it's risky?
How many were there altogether?
I didn't suspect anything.
I see a queen.
I don't really feel like reading.
You're turning red.
His speech impressed us very much.
This is your country.
Tom dressed himself quickly, then ran out the door.
I've got claustrophobia.
Tom spent a lot of time in Boston in 2013.
How can you be so sure of that?
I often buy bread from the bakery next to the post office.
How is it going?
Come with me to the station.
I don't know anything about him.
I have a friend who can speak French.
I'm short of cash at the moment.
It's good to get up early in the morning.
Tell me which one to choose.
I am new here.
You can't ride a horse.
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom asked Mary for assistance.
This will make you stronger.
That was very easy.
I am afraid that you will get lost.
A business cycle is a recurring succession of periods of prosperity and periods of depression.
Do I have your permission to do so?
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
I didn't have anything to eat.
Why don't you wear summer clothes?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
I've never heard of this actor.
That bed is very comfortable.
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
There isn't any milk left.
The pain started last night.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
He was brave.
I love autumn.
My life is in your hands.
Who called you?
This was easier than I thought.
Tom found out the truth.
He came to Tokyo at the age of three.
This meat has gone bad.
They like apples.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
I thought it was a good movie.
Let me get you some ice.
Why didn't you just leave?
Be very careful.
What's your opinion on this?
We're meant to be together.
It was a church event.
I'd better do something before the problem gets any worse.
How many bags did you have?
Charge this to my account.
Don't confuse astrology with astronomy.
I don't want you to enjoy it.
Stay sharp.
If you allow me to speak, I'll be able to explain everything.
Show us around.
If I don't do that now, I'll never do it.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
They made fun of my clothes.
"Does Tom love you?" "I think so."
The price is low, but the quality isn't very good.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Is this radio yours?
I respect the elderly.
I want you to dig a hole.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
You're too polite.
I'd say you're jealous.
I can't tell you how to do that.
I don't even have a car anymore.
I'd like to reserve a seat on this train.
Are you still at work?
Have you eaten lunch yet?
It's embarrassing.
They put off their departure due to the heavy snow.
Tom boiled some water.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
That could be a coincidence.
Don't be cruel to animals.
May I use your phone?
I can't detect any pattern.
They awarded her a gold metal for her achievement.
At least I'll die happy.
I seldom eat at home.
I'm not free to go this afternoon.
I want you to have my land after I die.
Tom's not in the best of health.
Tom used to be a better cook than Mary.
He arrived safe and sound.
The automobile industry is one of the main industries in Japan.
That's a good move.
I felt like singing loudly when the exam was over.
How do I get a hold of you?
They didn't swim because it was cold.
War may break out at any moment.
Where are you staying?
I have a delivery for you.
Is it your first day at school?
I can't stand it anymore.
You've put on weight, haven't you?
Get your gear.
This guy is really hot.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Get to the point!
How did you become interested in studying languages?
We finally have you where we want you.
I never had the opportunity to use it.
Tom said you wanted to talk to me.
Can I have the sugar, please?
Don't you want to know where I was?
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
I just want you to think about it.
Was there anything else you wanted me to do?
He is blinded by love.
He robbed an old lady.
Is Tom one of your friends?
May I have the check, please?
I want to hear from you.
I worried, of course.
I'll study harder in the future.
Let me do the cooking.
This novel is boring.
He arrived at the station out of breath.
We can't go there.
I plead guilty.
The water came up to my knees.
You think I don't know what's going on?
That's icky.
I never touch beer.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tom likes oranges.
Don't lean against this wall.
Tom almost always falls asleep at night hugging his teddy bear.
He is too young to go there alone.
Tom doesn't like to lose.
I am very tired from the hard work.
They cheat.
How many beers did you drink?
Don't you think Tom will be able to do that?
I don't know where you are now.
Would you like to switch seats?
Tom isn't friendly.
I actually have to run.
We want peace in the world.
Please throw me the ball.
That dress seems to be very expensive.
I think that's a mistake.
I never work during weekends.
I unlocked the door.
No one is around.
The accident took place near that intersection.
She has a hot temper.
We appreciate your help.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
Are you out of your mind?
The issue is quite familiar to us.
Can you sell the book to me for 500 yen?
Tell me where you went.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Draw a picture of yourself.
Tom removed his coat.
This can't be what it looks like.
Do you feel like going to the theater?
I saw the two together on several occasions.
I would like to meet you.
Who has eaten all the cookies?
As far as I know, he's a nice guy.
I didn't plan on staying.
We're going to do it again.
I'd like to get off at the next stop.
I can't bear the noise any longer.
Are you a wizard?
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
When did you buy this cello?
A dog bit her on the leg.
Do you have any brothers?
I don't think that's allowed here.
Do you have your laptop with you?
The stock market is very active.
Can I talk to you a sec?
What we should do next is the question.
My mother is active.
I wish I had asked you for advice.
They moved here three years ago.
I'm proud of you guys.
You're depressed, aren't you?
I want to get there early so we can get good seats.
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
He'll have to do this task again.
Shall we add a bit more salt?
We've got a leak.
Where can we have lunch?
Read this now.
He built a fence around his house.
I made him sweep the floor.
The rules are simple.
She decided to study abroad.
She is the one you should model yourself after.
You must learn from your mistakes.
Dinosaurs became extinct a very long time ago.
I ruined everything.
The Catholic Bible contains everything in the Protestant Bible plus several other books.
Do you like fish?
It's supposed to be the other way around.
I hope that she will get well soon.
It's very easy to use.
Your name is familiar to me.
Love your neighbors.
Alice will tell you that in Wonderland everything is topsy-turvy.
I used to have one, but it was stolen.
Can you light the way?
What did your father teach you?
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
They're barely paid minimum wage.
How could you help me?
The campers were hard up for water because their well had run dry.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like me?
You could've told me the truth.
Tom parked the car behind Mary's house.
My home is your home.
He had a terrible experience.
I got dumped, again.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
He plays tennis very well.
I totally believe you.
Careful driving prevents accidents.
They're going to try.
You don't look very good.
I saw him cross the road.
That's a horse of a different color.
Let me pay my share.
He's not at home.
Did you read the instructions?
I feel kind of frustrated.
I admire your determination.
I've waited for a month.
You're blushing.
You're completely delusional.
Your question has no answer.
I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
I rode my bicycle to the store.
What was the first concert you went to?
It doesn't rain here very often.
I have a pair of red shoes.
He ran his fingers through her hair.
It cost $300 to get the car fixed.
The child sat on his mother's lap and listened to the story.
You might want to have someone look into that matter.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
Do you think it's worthwhile? I don't think so.
We must take that risk.
You were telling the truth, weren't you?
He did not understand her joke.
I want to know what this is all about.
My son wants to be a professional golfer.
We had a large audience.
What woke you up?
"I like traveling." "So do I."
I wonder if Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Even though it's small, it's still a great car.
I saw him crossing the road.
Remember what happened last time.
I saw him naked.
She wouldn't go for a walk with him.
You don't have to make up an excuse if you don't want to go with us.
There's a bus stop in front of our school.
Every student was asked one question.
What's it like?
I hope you're happy, too.
You look a little young to be a teacher.
We're the last.
You should call the police.
The plane flew above the clouds.
These shoes are too small.
You were terrified, weren't you?
I'm not doing that.
To his surprise, the door opened by itself.
I am proud of being a doctor.
Tell me where to put these books.
I went to the theater early to get a good seat.
You probably need a drink.
You need to be more patient.
Where did you have the suit made?
I've never had a friend quite like you.
Is it something you can get rid of?
This couch is very comfortable.
I can't do it today.
Don't be so impatient.
I will buy a watch at the store.
You lied to Tom.
The enemy attacked the town.
Tom says he's planning to buy a gift for Mary.
Don't be so shy.
He is equal to the task.
Living in the town is quite different from living in the country.
Those are mine, I think.
I don't have a ticket.
Did you get fired from your last job?
Tom doesn't drink beer at home.
What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done?
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Without me, you won't be able to do it.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
I like to run.
Where's the hospital?
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Do you like cooking?
I don't have the answer.
You have something of a reputation.
Have you seen my new car?
We'll always remember Tom.
Let's talk about why you want to do that.
I think you're drunk.
I'll be getting married in October.
Why are you bleeding?
Stay with me.
My uncle lives in the east of Spain.
You look a little pale.
I paid $200 in taxes.
Give me a hug.
She has a long nose.
Who wants it?
I'll tell you what I know.
At least you'll have something to write home about.
He went there instead of me.
He began to look for a job.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
That's just awesome.
Tom and Mary have always been friends.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo.
How much do you have invested?
All the boys ran away.
I'm no friend of yours.
I want a low table.
Let's just forget it ever happened.
I always watch the weather report before going out in the morning.
How did you obtain this painting?
Have another drink.
Your idea differs entirely from mine.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
There have been a lot of complaints from consumers that our products don't last as long as we claim.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
There've been times when doing that has caused us problems.
You look as healthy as ever.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
You don't seem tired at all.
His ideas never earned him a dime.
Why were you there?
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
My legs are fine.
He gave him a book.
I just saw a huge owl.
Do you think that Tom is happy?
We saw paramedics treating the gunshot victims.
Everybody thought so.
He is a potential world champion.
I would love to try that out.
Have a drink, Tom.
Are you alone?
I held his sleeve.
How important is music in your life?
I have a lot of time.
The population of this city is decreasing every year.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
The ice will crack beneath our weight.
They're the cream of the crop.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
I'm not going to the movies tomorrow.
In the north, it's cold in the winter.
I was just fooling around.
Everyone looked relieved.
You'd do the same thing if you were me.
I forgot my email address.
Give me a drink.
I have a friend coming over to visit tomorrow.
Don't worry about it!
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
This book belongs to you.
Could we talk in private?
We lost all of our money.
I love to party.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
This is pretty.
How much is it including insurance and tax?
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
I'm not late, am I?
She is not tall.
A deal is a deal.
I just want to talk to you.
They awarded her first prize at the flower show.
The ground was covered with frost this morning.
I refused to eat until my parents came home.
Show me everything.
Nothing can stop him.
Don't you think this suits me?
He likes my jokes.
I don't believe a word of what people have been saying about her.
Let's not wait any longer.
I am sending the invoice by fax.
The talks will last three days.
Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?
This canoe is not safe.
It's not as easy as people think.
I usually have dinner at seven.
That's a horse of a different colour.
You didn't turn in your homework.
Will I have the pleasure of seeing you again?
I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away.
Stay here all night if you want.
Tom looks interested.
It's so clean.
He may have seen it.
I hate hypocrisy.
Will he recover?
I went on reading.
He tried in vain to open the locked door.
It was a huge success.
I'm proud of that.
I want you to find out.
Practice is the best teacher.
I appreciate all you did.
Do you need a few minutes?
His office is on the eighth floor.
He shaves four times a week.
I think it's going to get steadily hotter from now.
He is a considerate father.
How can I make a telephone call to Japan?
Tom quite often sleeps more than eight hours.
Where are you staying?
Tom and Mary have been trying to come up with a solution to the problem.
A molecule of water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.
Are you getting tired?
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
Can I have your phone number?
I've just arrived at the station.
Your watch is on the desk.
I'm not really worried about that.
I think it's time for me to go.
He talks as though he knew everything.
He went to Boston by car.
If you are hungry, you can eat the bread.
Come on, let's do it.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to stay.
They accused him of telling a lie.
You can swim, can't you?
Let's start!
He broke the law.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
I'm sure she'll leave early.
You can't wear that.
It's not secure.
We noticed the man enter her room.
It happened on Halloween night.
Can you please close the window?
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
I really don't want to talk about this.
I'll be glad to help him.
I want to be noticed.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
I want you and me to be happy.
There was nothing but sand as far as the eye could see.
I am very dangerous.
You're not the only one with this problem.
Look at that building.
Are you going by bus or car?
He asked her questions.
His students adored him.
The meeting was just about over.
I appreciate your situation.
I was choked by smoke.
I am learning to play the guitar now.
Please sit down for a moment.
I know you have it.
This can't be what it looks like.
Children need to play.
Pick a card.
You can't blame him.
There's nothing we can do.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
Did you find that helpful?
Suddenly, all the lights went out.
Anyone who says so is a liar.
He's three years older than she is.
We're out of coffee.
Look, I'll show you.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
What is the difference between this and that?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I heard them coming.
They did not listen.
This is not enough.
We're happy with our car.
She didn't want him to die.
Now that I have enough money, I can get that camera.
Tom and Mary are a nice couple.
Try us again next Monday.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Someone has stolen all my money.
I lied to my boyfriend about my age.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Tom is claustrophobic.
I just couldn't help myself.
Beef, please.
What were her final words?
We didn't get paid this week.
Please write down your name.
You'll feel better if you take this medicine.
Do you think the road is wide enough for cars?
They all need attention.
It is too dark to play outside.
He speaks Portuguese.
Tom isn't in a good mood today.
He asked me who I thought would win the race.
The man must be insane.
Please translate this into French.
Tom didn't have to get up so early.
I heard from someone that she got married.
I got tired of lying in bed all day.
He is listening to the news on the radio.
The lake can be reached in half an hour by bus.
I had to stop.
I forgave you a long time ago.
Would you have time to fix this flat tire now?
That's weird, isn't it?
She will get well soon.
Do you know where the supermarket is?
Tom is wiser than me.
Don't take this the wrong way.
Why don't you go to school with us?
Come quickly.
I'll support him.
Some people are still worried.
How much will all this cost?
We'll all be there.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
When do you want to eat?
I am accustomed to staying up late.
I was hurt and upset.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
We're from the same neighborhood.
The police are questioning witnesses.
No comment.
What would you say if you were in my place?
Tom went home for the weekend.
Some people seem to agree with you.
Who are these two boys?
It's difficult to help people that don't want your help.
The sun is about to set.
I would hate to become just a housewife.
That is all.
Speak louder, please.
That's disgusting.
I don't speak Spanish.
Tom was heartbroken when his dog died.
We bought a house.
What is this called?
No one here seems to want our help.
Please close the window.
I think Tom is pulling your leg.
I'm waiting to see if it's true.
The leaves blew away in the wind.
She handed him the money that she owed him.
You don't need to do that.
That girl has a lovely doll.
I can fall back on my savings if I lose my job.
I will protect you.
Tom actually figured it out by himself.
Do you really love me?
I want to live in a town.
I can't find anything.
Can you stay and watch the children?
Someone will do it.
Did I really do that?
The joke's on you.
Can you think of any better way to do this?
Did you study yesterday?
They know what's going on.
He drinks himself unconscious every night.
I'm not sure anything happened.
Everybody seeks happiness.
Why do you need change?
And now, it's my turn!
That doesn't work at all.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
Don't you ever call Tom?
I'll join you.
I like trout fishing.
He was checking you out.
I hear laughing.
We'd better get out of here.
We're missing something here.
Have a seat, won't you?
Tom told Mary that he'd go to Boston in October.
I like both of them very much.
He knows many amusing magic tricks.
It's our third day in Boston.
I don't want to get involved.
Don't respond to questions marked with an X.
We were surprised at his conduct.
You need to be more patient.
I am taking a holiday at the beach.
Take care not to catch a cold.
She had her handbag stolen.
Does this ring a bell?
Are you all right?
This is all I can do.
I didn't see Tom yesterday.
Is college worth it?
I do not mind what you do.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Spring is the best season to visit Kyoto.
I like to drink natural mineral water.
You're turning thirty.
How's the project going?
I wish I could go with you, but as it is, I can't.
The last time when I saw him, he was quite well.
I know I got it right this time.
Tom is rather optimistic.
She asked him to read it for her because she had lost her glasses.
I like China.
A selfish man thinks of nothing but his own feelings.
How do I know you didn't do it?
I admire your perseverance and determination.
I won't close the door.
I've got some rather serious news.
That's what I'd like to do.
If you want to succeed in life, work hard.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
The tower is going to collapse.
I can't just kick Tom out.
It will cost you $100 to fly to the island.
How do you intend to do that?
I just don't want to catch your cold.
It's mine.
I thought I heard someone in the kitchen.
That makes things clear.
What are you so angry about?
Why don't we go swimming?
How did you know it was me?
Do you have a valid passport?
I plan on being early.
The train had already left when we got to station.
Where were you? We've been looking all over for you.
He can play both tennis and baseball.
Tom didn't do what he was asked.
Have you ever thought of becoming a nurse?
I know what they mean.
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep.
Kids are smarter than you think.
Tom left his umbrella in the classroom.
Who is playing the guitar?
What does this word mean?
Either you or she has to go there.
The engine started again.
How long have you had this pain?
Evil always wins.
Tom passed away last night.
I have no idea where we are.
Don't forget to take your pills.
I've been expecting good news from them.
She despises him only because he is poor.
I had loads of fun.
I don't like being interrogated.
I'll finish it in one hour.
I told him what to do.
When was Tom fired?
She plays the piano very well.
It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
The U.S. Department of Health says people should exercise at least two and a half hours a week.
Tell me where the wine is.
Come home at once.
This flower is beautiful, isn't it?
A mile is equal to about 1600 meters.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I shave every morning.
She is distantly related to him.
School begins tomorrow.
He took poison by mistake.
I just don't want to die.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
Are there any risks?
Follow that car.
Tom had one of his legs amputated.
Who's next on the list?
He broke the door open.
Mother bought me a new bicycle.
I really, really need it.
Stop changing the subject.
Didn't you feel like going?
I think there's going to be trouble.
Have you finished the work yet?
It's difficult to evaluate his ability.
"Natto" smells awful, but tastes delicious.
We are hoping for your quick recovery.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
There's nothing we can do about it.
I might be wrong.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
I love Christmas music.
We were looking for you.
Shape up or ship out!
What were you thinking about?
Can you handle it?
She kept quiet.
I can get us there more quickly.
I just wanted to help Tom.
Why are you so busy today?
Those dogs are big.
I need to take a shower.
I did it myself.
I don't owe you anything.
My car is being repaired.
We all deserve a chance.
They all drank.
It will cost you more to go by plane.
I was unlucky.
I saw Tom's face.
I was misinformed.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
The laundry can wait.
I like these.
I like to dream.
Are you lonely?
He denounced all forms of dishonesty in government.
I don't know who Tom gave that to.
He was killed in a railroad accident.
When I'm hot, a glass of cool water really refreshes me.
I have no experience.
Who do you think he is?
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
I saw a shape in the dark.
Do you know anything about your family?
Would you teach me?
Are you unlucky?
It's getting there.
Do you want to make a deal?
I really see no reason to leave.
Tell me how I can help you.
Tom told us to be quiet.
I had my brother clean my room.
I know what you're probably thinking.
You must always do what is right.
You should not go alone.
She must have finished the work yesterday.
My dream is to become a very strong mahjong player.
I don't want to fight you.
Do you have a dictionary?
Just remember I dropped everything to be here for you.
The goods arrived undamaged.
Keep away from me.
Personally, I think you're right.
I wonder why Tom is so skinny.
She warned him not to go alone.
Take Tom outside.
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
The fire started immediately.
We ran out of money.
I'm getting married this year.
It's all about money.
The terrible scene sent shivers down his spine.
How could you think that?
He won't live more than one day.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
He assumed an aggressive attitude toward me.
I don't like that either.
I wonder if anything happened to him.
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Are we going for a walk?
I didn't know that Tom hadn't done what he was supposed to do.
Opportunity seldom knocks twice.
I need information.
Are you with us, Tom?
You'd better go in person.
I still don't like it.
The gate needs to be closed.
Both of them seem suspicious.
Tom will be here every day.
The tower can be seen from here.
Please don't tell anyone.
Tell me the meaning of life.
As far as I know, Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
I was very glad to hear the news.
Please think about it.
I got dumped.
She lives with him in a small apartment.
Don't say that word ever again.
There was another one.
It's settled then.
He's already left.
I located the town on the map.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Is this building open to the public?
Another thing that is required is a dictionary.
There's nothing I can do.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
Everything has been arranged.
A wink was his only answer.
Tom and Mary got married last October.
Rwandan rebels are pushing their offensive south as fighting continues in the capital Kigali.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Are you insinuating something?
We have no special plans.
I couldn't catch what he said.
I'm not home on Sundays.
I need water.
Good things come in small packages.
I still think it's unlikely that he'll come today.
Tom would never leave Mary.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
You're unforgettable.
Some dogs are very smart.
I'll be with you in a sec.
I wish we'd met earlier.
I go to any party I am invited to.
Have you lost your ticket?
If you push the button, the engine will stop.
I don't care what people think.
Enjoy your trip.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary went to the hospital.
They made the decision.
That plane is enormous!
No one likes war.
Never argue with a drunk.
You're a liar.
Keep your shoes on.
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
Is that really a road we want to go down?
In those days, few people could travel abroad.
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
How many do you see now?
The plane will land before long.
Have you read any good books lately?
What sport do you like best?
She is familiar with Japanese history.
Don't change a thing.
It's a comedy movie.
This is on sale.
Choose between these two.
I have to get up quite early tomorrow.
You don't have to know all the details.
I think Tom is a really nice kid.
It's a fine day.
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday.
We saw a stranger walking outside.
What if something goes wrong?
The man must be insane.
How come I've never seen you here before?
You must get off at the next station.
It was foolish of him to waste his money on such trifles.
Sit down, Tom!
I don't know what that meant.
Tom wanted to speak with Mary.
There is honor even among thieves.
I can't think of any other plan.
We were undefeated.
Thanks for the ride.
You can work faster than that.
I've loved you since the day I first saw you.
Why did you keep that a secret?
You can't mix oil with water.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
He has been dead for five years.
No one uses that kind of weapon anymore.
Tom and Mary can both speak French.
It's impossible to describe.
I have not been able to go to school for a week.
Are you seeing anybody now?
It's time to go.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
Don't you think I would like to do that?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it's the truth.
I just want to hang out with you.
Can you get that to me by the end of the day?
You'd better try something else.
One student was arrested.
The severely injured man was dead on arrival at the hospital.
I don't believe that Tom is guilty.
Everyone wins.
It's a good story.
I'd be angry, too.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
I got you all right where I want you.
Tom stopped it.
Can you read music?
I was talking about something else.
She showed me her room.
I wish I had more time to talk with her.
Where are you living now?
Try it again.
Tom has three sisters.
Keep these rules in mind.
Who allowed him in?
I would very much like to go.
The meeting is ten days away.
How much more suffering can they endure?
My uncle has a glass eye and a wooden leg.
It's about time you were independent of your parents.
How am I still alive?
The cook prepares different dishes every day.
She asked me what had become of him, but I didn't know.
Do you really want this information to be made public?
Can I talk to someone who speaks French?
I thank you for that.
Who's going to drive?
I've had a little bit too much to drink.
They know we're cops.
I know Tom is conscientious.
We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth.
I'll wait for you in my room.
I like women.
Tom isn't accustomed to walking barefooted.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Human beings differ from other animals in that they can speak and laugh.
There were some boats on the lake.
I'm giving it back.
Would you do it with me?
I don't feel like studying.
Tom and Mary realized that they weren't really compatible.
She denied having been there.
He has a big mouth.
Tom told me I shouldn't swim there.
We have to find another way to do that.
She lives in the country.
Write me if you need help.
Please don't distract me from my work.
He showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
I couldn't understand a single word of what they said.
I know them.
He pretended to be a doctor.
A merchant is a person who buys and sells goods.
I need all of it.
Justice will prevail.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to learn enough French in just three weeks.
Do you really think Tom is drunk?
This steak is too tough.
I didn't think you would win the race.
I'll be back.
I'm interested in oriental pottery.
Something embarrassing happened last week.
Look under the seat.
That should only take me a few minutes.
How's Tom doing?
Can she ride a bicycle?
I felt excited.
Wouldn't you rather sit by the window?
It's not a virus.
Why are you so sad?
Can you pay me in advance?
Would it be all right if I visited you today?
Tom spent a week in Boston.
I found these.
I'm offering you a job.
Tom helped us extinguish the fire.
If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now.
I have your schedule here.
Tell me.
I thought I recognized you.
Ask me tomorrow.
It's fun to learn slang words in foreign languages.
Tell me when to start.
I know what you were doing.
I'm glad you came over.
You should stop drinking.
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room.
My dream is to become a pilot.
You're a very good football player.
I may not have time.
I was asked by my uncle what I intended to be when I graduated from college.
I think you deserve more than this.
Come in, the door's open.
Man can't live without dreams.
We dance together.
How's your sister today?
The press is interested in his private life.
Tom is small.
I like sashimi.
We're practically brothers.
I know those women.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
If I were you, I wouldn't do it.
We're sneaky.
You missed a lot.
They're good friends of ours.
Are you willing to take that chance?
It is a pity you cannot come.
I know Tom saved Mary's life.
He emptied his glass.
I know you hired a lawyer.
I thought he wouldn't come.
All plants need water and light.
I like him not because he is kind but because he is honest.
I'm not who you think I am.
Should I call you or will you call me?
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
Clean it up.
She was watching the dead leaves fall.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
Why didn't anyone say that?
He asked me out on a date.
They're expensive.
He plays the piano very well.
I must have my work finished by tomorrow.
I love the great outdoors.
Children should obey authority.
What's your favorite kind of fish?
She was nearly frozen to death in the snow.
Someone is singing.
I'll be happy to help you.
This is what'll happen.
I am determined to give up smoking.
He regrets his mistake.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
How did I look?
If you had a time machine, which year would you visit?
You should've told me this before.
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
I'll show you around the town.
You can't just go.
It gave me the creeps.
There is no problem.
This gun is reportedly very powerful.
It's easy if you try.
We're fine.
None of this makes any sense to me.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
They spent the night on the beach.
I got up early as usual.
Sit near here.
Do your homework by yourself.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
Is there a garden in front of the house?
Step inside.
Don't think about that anymore.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
I don't make deals with people like you.
Tom counts on Mary.
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
But I don't think it's at all odd.
I had to resign because I just didn't get along with the new boss.
Choose three books at random.
I had a pleasant dream last night.
Like I said, I was busy.
I had intended to go with Tom.
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
He's getting soft in his old age.
I really don't know where to start.
Are you coming to the party?
I am baking bread.
Can you verify that this message is from Tom?
I don't think I can do anything.
Buy me a drink.
I have lived in Tokyo since 1985.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Don't act surprised.
Let go of me.
The police aren't after us anymore.
I'm the killer.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I let the cat in.
Where do you get off telling me anything?
I worked on Sunday, so I had Monday off.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
He is a self-made man.
Does this mean you won't be sleeping here?
I really don't have anything else to say.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
I told him to be quiet.
I'm sick of you.
Elephants were killed for their ivory.
The police captured the escaped criminal.
We hope to see you again.
Am I allowed to use this?
I was living in Boston a few years ago.
It's been five years since my father passed away.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
Are you sure?
Is there someone here who speaks French?
I thought that you were able to speak French.
Which is your suitcase?
How many hours does it take to go to Okinawa by plane?
I got there ahead of time.
How do you plan to help me?
You can't blame me for that.
All our money is gone.
I'll remember that.
Do you know who you’re talking to?
Don't talk to my sister like that.
I'm hung over.
Does Tom speak French fluently?
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
Where on earth did you meet him?
Do you have a Facebook account?
Tom calls Mary every night.
You didn't have to ask.
Are you coming to the store with me?
I'm clean.
Both of them are hungry.
He studied military history.
A noise woke her up.
I quite agree with you.
If I were in her place, I wouldn't give up yet.
Tom was highly educated and spoke several languages fluently.
That was awesome.
You're very attractive.
I didn't sleep much last night.
Whose house is across from yours?
I would like to thank you for accepting my invitation.
He asked me to wake him at six.
Tom has been offered a job in Australia.
Go and see who it is.
I must learn Japanese.
This is excellent wine.
It didn't happen that way.
The results for the English exam this time were very good.
I promise I won't tell.
We haven't yet finished what we have to do.
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
Can you forgive me?
You gotta get more organized.
He may have been right.
Tom asked a few questions that Mary didn't want to answer.
I don't see Tom as often as I'd like.
I outrank you.
I don't care a bit about the future.
What was the outcome?

We can either go to the beach or go mountain climbing. We can't do both.
I have to solve this problem.
What do you remember?
You're jealous.
I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
What is your decision?
Why did they hire you?
I think you should see a doctor.
Tom put new pedals on the bicycle that he rides to school.
Does she always go there?
I made these.
You're the teacher.
That's about it.
You're not allowed to park here.
With the coming of spring, everything is gradually coming to life again.
How much is your hourly pay?
I just want to know what I'm getting into.
This is a beautiful house.
I missed the school bus!
She was eager to go home.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
They camped on the beach.
That dress looks really nice on you.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
I love both of you.
You weren't married for long, were you?
That was some storm.
Your parents must be so proud of you.
Do you have any cough medicine?
I thought that would be a great idea.
Reading books is very interesting.
She goes to school on foot.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
I'm out of shape.
Some people relax by reading.
He was paralyzed by fear.
Why don't you leave me alone?
He slipped while crossing the street.
Why are you visiting us?
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
I missed you last night.
I have caught a cold.
It was the only way.
Someone knocked on the door.
I admire his talent.
I have nothing to do with the crime.
This rule applies to all cases.
When do you plan to start?
He was proud that he was selected by the people.
I think I'll go to Boston next weekend.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
I can't believe your mom made you wear that.
He is running short of funds.
Quit bothering me.
Did you see that?
We haven't had much rain this year.
The flowers in the garden are very beautiful.
What did you do today?
Tom began to worry about Mary.
He felt the same way as I did.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Tom crossed the street.
Never choose a vocation just because it looks profitable.
He is interested in music.
He grasped the rope with two hands.
This is between you and me.
You have chosen the best.
We're not involved.
"I'm not interrupting anything, am I?" "No, of course not."
I don't know where my keys are.
Do you think he did the job on his own?
Thanks a million.
Let's do it.
Tom doesn't know how to ski.
Is everything all right in there?
I don't care what you do.
He was perfect.
You don't have to go there.
Today is our last day of school.
Do you want the job or not?
He's about to leave.
I'm afraid you'll have to learn to live with the pain.
We need your help.
Suit yourself.
I don't think that's right.
Are you still jealous?
We grow a variety of crops.
It's hard to know what to do.
He drinks his coffee black every time.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
That box is heavy.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
She is constantly writing letters.
I have never been to America.
I don't want to miss my train.
We had a blast.
Tom has decided to stay.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
You have to go on without me.
Did you send them?
I sat at the front in order to hear the lecture clearly.
You've gone too far this time.
Write in the date yourself.
I always knew you were a nice guy.
Around half of the audience were female.
I'll do that tomorrow if possible.
I've been away too long already.
They won't have arrived yet.
Are you finished with your work?
You're not helping, Tom.
I don't care for green tea.
He always talks as if he knows everything.
Tom changed.
That's what we have to figure out.
She looked worried about her school report.
Refer to the Users' Guide if you have any problems.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
I want you to get a good night's rest.
I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
If you have any difficulty, ask me for help.
I'll never be that famous.
It's not at all impossible.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
She wrote to her parents at least once a week.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.
They basked in the sun.
I can do it if you give me a chance.
A car is a must for life in the suburbs.
I'm not sure I believe you.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
It's just a dream.
Who is the man playing the piano?
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I was born in October.
Is your car new?
You need to come home right now.
Japan has undergone a drastic change as a result of industrialization.
Tom is supposed to meet me here.
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
Do you want this?
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
Don't let Tom frighten you.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
An arrest warrant was issued for the company's accountant.
Everybody in the building felt the earthquake.
I have heard nothing from him for five years.
Where are you going to sleep?
I'll kill the both of you.
Why would anybody eat pickled cabbage?
I really don't feel like talking.
Tom wrote the report.
I knew something was up.
In case I forget, please remind me.
You were fantastic.
I didn't learn anything new.
What are you up to?
Will you lend me your CD player for an hour?
Don't kid me!
They were plainly dressed.
Things went great last night.
What is the emergency telephone number?
We'll miss Tom.
Tom had never seen such a beautiful garden before.
I found something interesting in the town.
I thought you were serious.
Little by little, the bird made his nest.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Never forget to put out the fire.
That is a very complex machine.
What have you come here for?
I must have made a mistake.
May I have a look at that?
I'm surprised to see you smoking. You didn't used to.
Pass me the butter, please.
Tom has to act now.
He deals in hardware.
I'm running Linux on my laptop.
A man was complaining of something in a sharp voice.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
It'll be easy to find a renter for this house.
We're not supposed to do that.
You said it yourself.
I wish you were here with me now.
He always says the same thing.
It really was hard.
You're aggressive.
You can bet your boots on that.
Would you hand me that?
Thank you for coming to meet me.
I will call in order to confirm it.
You're very forward.
I can survive alone.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
This box contains assorted chocolates.
You must not give up.
Why do people dye their hair?
Tom is still wearing his wedding ring, even though he's not married anymore.
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
I feel like taking a bath now.
The kids are asleep.
Everyone is in the living room watching TV.
My hands are shaking.
Read it once more.
He is popular with everybody.
This is the end of the world as we know it.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
The cat is licking itself.
Who did you go with?
Don't let Tom do it alone.
I really have to go.
I really don't think that's necessary.
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party.
The first edition was published ten years ago.
We arrived at the office on time.
I think he has enough intelligence to understand it.
Since my mother was sick, I looked after her.
Those are my CDs.
I am going to the post office to buy stamps.
She lost her father when she was three years old.
Are you responsible for this?
He let me leave the room.
It was the happiest time of my life.
It is going to rain this afternoon.
I could hardly hear him.
Tom left his keys on the table.
He is related to me by marriage.
I'm not feeling quite up to par.
I can't understand anything Tom is saying.
They cheat.
A well-made cup of coffee should require no cream or sugar.
If it had not been for his help, I would have failed.
She got married at the age of 17.
I don't know if I can believe that.
Don't let them go to waste.
My father is fifty years old.
It's a stupid idea.
Can you solve this problem?
Do you like music?
I forgot to give him the message.
I don't like the tie that you're wearing.
Tom opened the curtains.
What is my room number?
Let's do it!
I figured it out by myself.
Kiss me.
Frankly speaking, your way of thinking is out of date.
I was ready today.
What does this have to do with our current problems?
Why should I give you this?
He did not listen.
Don't get an upset stomach by eating too much.
What do you need four cars for?
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
Parents should monitor their children's activities.
I want to cry.
Something is slowing down my computer.
I can't stand ignorant people.
He doesn't have a hat on.
She advised him to go to the hospital.
I'm not busy right now.
I couldn't hear what they were saying.
I like hanging out with you.
I owe him $100.
I read your report.
Do I smell bacon?
Are you still sick?
I would appreciate a reply.
Sorry, we're full today.
Why did you marry him?
You've said enough.
I thought I might be of some use.
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent.
I suppose you already know that's my car.
I don't want to eat any more.
She danced with joy.
They talked on the phone every night.
I could see that Tom was grinning.
Tom has a brilliant future.
I lived in Australia for three years.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
What do you want to be?
Most signs are written in English.
I feel wonderful.
You couldn't have picked a better time.
I just brewed a pot.
My cold is getting worse.
She writes me every week.
It's just a placebo.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
As soon as I got home, the telephone rang.
Life without love has no meaning.
I did OK.
I am alarmed by your irresponsible attitude.
You have to learn how to compromise.
Where are we going next?
I do hope you understand.
She met him on the beach.
He made an effort to pass the examination.
I cover twenty miles a day.
It was very ugly.
Don't be so negative.
I'm not good-looking.
What's Tom's office number?
I can't believe you actually did that.
I was just here yesterday.
I wonder if you ever think of me.
What do you like about her?
If you do this for me, I'll never ask you to do anything else.
I can't remember how to go there.
I've been trying to get your attention.
We don't want any freeloaders around here.
I'd better go.
You are only young once.
I feel kind of tired.
I'm exhausted.
It's all I know.
There is no need for you to stay here.
I can't do two things at once.
Is the dog swimming?
Many people spend more than they earn.
You must pay in advance.
I sure appreciate all your help.
Can you explain your answer?
Which newspaper would you prefer?
I wonder when the Civil War started.
They deported Tom.
I suppose I'd better be more careful the next time.
He let us go.
Don't let the children monopolize the television.
He bothered her with questions.
I want to eat something.
Do you like French?
Is lunch included in this price?
Who broke the news of her death to you?
His girlfriend did it for him.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
He thinks I'm jealous.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
How's your mother?
His long speech bored everyone.
Why are you always complaining?
Do you think Tom is dangerous?
Machines may one day think, but they'll never laugh.
I'll give you money if you need some.
Have you seen this video?
Did I give you enough time?
I want to be here with you.
My aim is to be a doctor.
I hate my boss.
Summer is over.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
It's rare to meet nice people like you.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
I could not stop laughing.
Have there been any phone calls for me?
I see they've put you to work.
What do you have in your hand?
We'll cooperate.
We must clean our classroom.
The pain is getting worse.
She's just putting up a front.
I sometimes wish I could live a quiet retired sort of life but I doubt I could stand it for more than a few days.
Can you make it safe?
I have a prior engagement.
She forced him to do it.
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
He looked up at the ceiling.
I don't like apples.
I'm a bit of a reader myself.
Have you ever seen her?
I thought it might be a good idea for us to get together and talk about it.
If that happens, call me.
I had nothing to do with her.
Are you mentally ill?
Tom forgot his trumpet at school.
It rained for three days on end.
What's the plan?
Let me handle this.
This is a difficult problem to solve.
Everyone will be happy.
She attempted suicide.
In a sense, you are right.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
You're driving too fast.
Butter is sold by the pound in the USA.
I had to help with the housework.
Tom doesn't like baseball very much.
Tom didn't need to get up so early.
He is in charge of entertaining the foreign guests.
Tom has money. However, he's not all that happy.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I'm going there alone.
I have something for you to do.
I'm getting tired of this.
Do you plan on moving?
Don't go to such a place at night.
I wonder how that works.
I am afraid it's too late.
I hope we achieve that.
I couldn't have done anything without Tom's help.
He balanced himself on a log.
Can I write it like that?
He is a good doctor.
I tried to help him.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I have no idea who she is.
It was a tedious job.
You shall have my answer tomorrow.
To drive a car, you need a license.
I'd like a city map.
Physics doesn't interest me at all.
The customs office is at the border.
People are sometimes tempted to eat more than they should.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
I tripped.
I like your style.
I know that you're vegetarians.
Did you see the news?
These figures don't add up.
I sleep standing up.
Don't forget to call your parents.
Everyone in his family is tall.
I loved going to the beach.
Isn't that annoying?
I don't have to go right away.
That house is haunted.
It's not like the movies.
I know exactly where I want to go.
You're not that smart.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you did your best.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
I suggest you cooperate.
Hand me that magazine.
He has a lot of money.
You'd better go. It's getting late.
I think it's important to tell the truth.
They didn't choose me.
Tom looks extremely happy.
I made a fortune.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
Tell me what really happened.
It's so obvious.
Who is the manager?
It's not about money.
What will that achieve?
I never would've believed that.
Are you telling me you've never studied French?
I use it.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
Tom was dying of thirst.
She kept on crying.
I want to find out if the warranty has expired yet.
I have questions.
This place has a mysterious atmosphere to it.
I bought a red diary.
The issue is not settled.
Where were you for the whole afternoon?
Tom smiled halfheartedly.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Do you want some coffee?
I had to get out of there.
No one died.
We don't know much about Tom.
I'm proud of you all.
I've always considered you a close friend.
I don't know the answer to that.
He is fluent in Chinese.
The water was cold.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
I don't plan on being a waiter all my life.
There isn't much time.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
I'll phone you later.
It's just the right size.
He wasn't watching TV then.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
I'll be waiting out front.
He took the public by surprise.
It was made to look like an accident.
You love your work, don't you?
We're all sure of that.
She asked him if he was a student at this school.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
We've accomplished a lot of things.
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.
She is not what she used to be.
I will bring it right away.
He sent money to help care for her.
You may need this.
Just as I was getting the hang of things, they changed the system.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
Prices have jumped.
I am not ready yet.
Fold up the map.
What do I have to do this time?
We had a traditional church wedding.
Tom is calling us a taxi.
I'd like to buy two 45-cent stamps, please.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
He is eating.
When was this car washed?
This is my mother.
A dog was run over by a truck.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
His parents loved me.
I don't want to be any more burden to my parents.
He had a new idea.
Have a nice trip.
It is impossible for him to finish it in an hour.
They just want to have fun.
I want a parrot.
How about running?
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
It's an old pain.
I can't go to the gym tonight.
Is her hair naturally red?
It's business.
I watched a movie with my friend in my room.
Take an umbrella with you in case it rains.
I am tired of hearing it.
Some of the money was stolen.
Can I have a moment with you?
That's 20% of the world's population.
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
I understand how you felt.
What an awful mother!
Do you have anything cheaper?
I messed up.
I like that tie of yours.
I'll definitely vote for Tom.
I would lodge a complaint.
She began to gain weight.
She bolted the doors and windows.
He must be very happy.
Tom wants to buy some books.
This isn't an easy task.
Are you sure about this?
I had dinner with a friend last night.
She gave me a present.
You can't give up.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
Your mother will repeat it to you as many times as necessary.
These two are very different from each other.
All the students passed the test.
I'm not a perfectionist.
I bet you'd make a great father.
Tom became an engineer.
That was my mistake.
Why did you come here?
It stopped snowing an hour ago.
I've heard a lot about you.
I like meat, but eggs do not agree with me.
He told her that he loved her.
The cat sat on the mat.
The sooner you leave, the better.
What's the score?
Tom was pacing back and forth in the parking lot, waiting for Mary.
It should be fun.
The plane gets in at eight o'clock.
I'd like to study French, but I don't have the time.
He's old and ugly.
You're stalling.
He speaks Arabic.
She cut her hand with a knife.
Can you turn that down?
Did anybody see you?
Why didn't they say something?
I feel terrible, but I've just broken your ashtray.
Don't you think this suits me?
Leave this to me.
What did you get hit with?
That's what I saw.
I wasn't informed of this.
I know Mary is pretty, but she's not very smart.
Don't leave things half finished.
Tom is dating someone.
We're glad you're here.
He blew on his fingers to make them warm.
I think it's time for me to retire.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I can't come up with a good excuse for being late for the dentist.
Who were you dreaming about?
That's acceptable.
I should get back upstairs.
A stone does not float.
What'll we do?
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
Tom said that Mary wasn't satisfied.
It's a shame that the singer died so young.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
Let's rest a little bit.
He seldom does anything he really hates to do.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
It's worth a try.
Do you understand what I am saying?
It's not safe here.
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I'm so full.
Let Tom make the decisions.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Some people see a conspiracy behind almost everything.
The horse is mine.
He's able to speak Japanese.
Is it complicated?
After eating supper, I washed the dishes.
Tom waited for Mary in front of the library all morning.
Please send me your latest catalogue.
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Your life depends on it.
I felt dumb.
Stop pulling my hair!
As far as I know, the novel is not translated into Japanese.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Summer vacation is soon.
I like chess.
No merchandise can be returned.
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
Let's take a short cut.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
Why didn't you listen to him?
She earns half as much money as her husband.
Could you please stop singing?
I wonder who took it.
We didn't stay home yesterday.
I let you catch me.
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
How can this be real?
I want to get into shape, so I've been working out every day.
I have run short of money.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
I shook hands with Tom.
I miss Tom's smile.
We had a lot of rain last month.
I have a friend waiting for me in the lobby.
That's not exactly how it happened.
You're either with me or you're against me.
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice.
It feels really good.
Our team is gaining ground.
I knew exactly what it was.
This is a funny sentence.
He was better than I expected.
That dog has a short tail.
Tom can barely speak French.
I already bought my ticket to Boston.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
I bought this umbrella three years ago.
We waited up for him until two o'clock and then finally went to bed.
Where's the oar?
Are you sleeping, Tom?
You did well, Tom.
Tom works at a computer company in Boston.
She married a local boy.
Neither one of them disagrees.
I always win.
Anybody want a lift?
I want to go back to doing what I was doing before you interrupted me.
Since the accident, Tom has given up hope of becoming a professional dancer.
You don't love Tom, do you?
I'm satisfied with everything.
My daughter will come of age next year.
Let me repair it.
It seemed likely.
I'm feeling kind of tired.
You need a joystick.
Are you ready for the next problem?
I like being on the team.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
Who are you? What're you doing here?
I wish I could have spoken Spanish.
Am I talented?
Tom didn't know who Mary was at first.
They elected her president.
Room service, please.
I saw you snickering.
I will accept the work, provided you help me.
I made an appointment to see him at seven o'clock.
He whispered sweet nothings into her ear.
You don't have a fever.
He did it just for fun.
That would take time.
I just didn't want to upset you.
Which book is yours?
He described exactly what happened.
Cabbage can be eaten raw.
She asked me about my mother.
You're the teacher.
Don't drink out of my glass.
Would you like to leave a message?
He is a lazy fellow.
Tom is a great sportsman.
You're acting like a child.
She got into the car and drove off.
She and I usually agree.
He will wait.
You make me laugh a lot.
Just give me what I want.
You seem a little desperate.
I've got to get home.
She's at a meeting.
I would advise against it.
He is the father of two children.
Did you catch the first train?
Not everything that you read on the Internet is true.
They want you dead.
There is no knowing when a severe earthquake will happen in Tokyo.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
You really annoy me.
I wasn't told that.
They had no food.
It always happens like this.
You're picky, aren't you?
Who are you there with?
Whether you like it or not, you have to do your homework.
Tom said you told him to wait.
That would've been entertaining.
We're all disappointed.
I'm not one to gossip.
I really liked that.
What you need is a friend.
I'll see you in the morning.
Tom put the first aid kit back where he found it.
I talked with her for an hour.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
She came very near to being run over by a car.
I have met him before.
My house seems small beside his.
She cried.
I just don't feel that way about you.
They did it in front of the staff.
I'm charmed to meet you.
Monday was a windy day.
Tom can't have written this letter himself.
Everyone started arguing.
We're unprejudiced.
In the U.S., it is common for people to write a check instead of paying cash.
Do you have a menu in English?
He lives apart from his family.
She stared him in the face.
How do you prefer your eggs?
She believed him when he said he loved her.
At the best hotels, there is always someone at your beck and call.
I made that for you.
It's time for us to do something about that.
I don't have to answer your questions.
Have you tried that before?
What's the real reason you're here?
I think Tom will win.
This is not a hospital.
I wanted to learn from the best.
I finished first.
Go up the stairs.
I feel sorry for her.
What language do you speak at home?
I want someone to talk to.
Sumo is a traditional Japanese sport.
What caused the explosion?
I wish I were taller.
The shooting has stopped.
I was disappointed with your paper.
I love your apartment.
What was your question?
I didn't go.
She has good control over her class.
When will you harvest your wheat?
Nobody likes war.
We'll die sooner or later.
I'm feeling very confident.
Tom needs you here.
Tom and Mary don't like the same kind of TV shows.
Correct the errors if there are any.
Do you want to eat out tonight?
What was it that you gave him?
I wish you could have come with me.
Tom took Mary in his arms and kissed her.
You must stay.
She didn't answer.
I was kind of expecting that to happen.
Give him an inch and he'll take a yard.
By the way, have you ever been to Hokkaido?
Tom deserved to be treated with respect.
I suspect that you won't like it.
He is still on his back.
I don't know what to do with it.
I know Tom quite well.
I'm the middle child of three.
I never go out.
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
I'd like to have a cat.
That's what's worrying me.
I asked Tom what he'd advise.
Was her story true?
I figured everybody knew that.
I am a shy boy.
Please teach me French.
I'll be gone until Sunday.
We want to have a large family.
There were a lot of murders last year.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Have you asked if they want one?
Can I try on this jacket?
I don't like any of them.
Why are you acting like this?
What is your emergency?
A wonderful idea occurred to me.
Where would you like to go?
It's red.
This desk is too heavy to lift.
Where's your suitcase?
I've lived a long time.
How could I resist?
Make your bed.
Sitting down all day and looking at a computer screen is bad for you.
What're you all dressed up for?
Barking dogs never bite.
Is that why you called?
Read this first.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
I thought this building was abandoned.
Thanks a bunch.
There is a lot of crime in big cities.
Give me the money you owe me and I'll be gone.
Where do you want to go?
All of the students stood up together.
Drinking and driving can be dangerous.
Do you want to watch a movie?
I never mentioned it again.
I haven't formed an opinion about that yet.
Everything is better without you.
Please show me that.
When I got out of jail, the first thing I bought was an economy car.
You are not allowed to turn left on this street.
I had to finish what I'd started.
The chickens were killed by a fox.
I'll take him.
I went straight to bed.
Are you with someone?
What don't you have?
He was a fresh face in American politics.
I fired the gun.
How long have you waited?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Give him a break!
Do they have their suitcases?
You drive a hard bargain.
I'm not old enough.
Can you speak French well?
Many students go to Europe for the purpose of studying music.
We arrived tired and hungry.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
Do you think I'm ugly?
He did not believe anyone had the right to do so.
I'm sorry. I have another appointment.
The news can't be true.
It is as if the whole sky were on fire.
Have you seen him before?
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Try and do your homework by yourself.
Walk as fast as possible.
That guy is a bandit.
Kids do stupid things.
You'll have to learn to cook.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
It's is so difficult that I have decided to give up trying.
You're assertive.
His careless driving caused the accident.
Tom doesn't know how to swim.
My mother has gone shopping.
We made it out of there.
We caught you.
Why can't you come?
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
It's almost Christmas.
I'll do as you advise.
If you don't want me to go, I won't.
I will do my best.
Let's open the window.
Tom looks awesome.
Do you believe in God?
Please help yourself to the chocolate cake.
I am going to work out the problem by myself.
Who are you to judge?
We're only friends.
This happens all the time.
Whose is this bicycle?
What's your natural hair color?
I have no excuse.
He likes to hunt.
Tom is leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
Why do you take that medicine?
Do you know how my friends describe me?
I don't think they did this.
Stop the car now.
Tom didn't know he'd hurt anybody.
I gave orders I was to be left alone.
Come into the room after me.
My sister plays the piano every day.
I let the dog out.
It was silly of him to refuse her offer.
The population is growing.
I make it a rule to study math every day.
The train arrived on time.
That's my opinion.
No one was there.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to cancel the trip.
Maybe I should study German.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
He is selfish and greedy.
It was in the 1920s that a big earthquake destroyed Tokyo.
She doesn't look happy.
Do you have to do this very often?
I guess it's too late to do that now.
Are you busy?
I had to work.
Boil some water.
Are you still jealous?
You won't die today.
We're eating breakfast indoors.
The capital of Poland is Warsaw.
Why are you surprised?
You're not as smart as me.
That guy is an outlaw.
Could you give me a ride?
If you're not with us then you're against us.
You're not fired.
I got it through my head that my parent's strict rules were for my own benefit.
I haven't had much sleep.
What does your son do?
Almost everyone participated.
I hope you follow my advice.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I don't have a younger sister.
It's improbable.
All the ingredients are fresh.
I've spent all the money.
Let's take a taxi.
It was a wise decision.
Don't be so impatient.
I want you to help me clean it up.
I helped Tom do some chores.
If I told you, you wouldn't understand.
Check, please.
I was attacked.
You two fight it out.
Let's get in the truck.
Tom and Mary went outside.
My life is boring.
What a loser!
I thought I told you to cut your hair.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
My son is small for his age.
Is that what you said?
Have you ever been to Venice?
I was moved by his tears.
You seem really busy.
They're special.
I've been doing it all my life.
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
His story made us laugh.
It might rain tomorrow.
It's not that I don't want to go, I can't afford to.
I was asked to umpire the game.
Even children can understand it.
They discussed his proposals at the meeting.
There are cherry trees on both sides of the street.
We need to talk.
Tom works in Boston.
They are negotiating to reach a satisfactory compromise.
We were very close.
I just don't understand you.
Make sure to back up all your files.
Make a decision and make it with the confidence that you are right.
Tom hasn't been back to Boston in a long time.
He is bad at driving.
You're very astute.
Tom is trying to break the lock.
He seemed disappointed at the results.
You're very skeptical.
Please wait on him first.
I've just put new sheets on my bed.
Tom doesn't know what he'll do.
This is an ancient law.
I'll see you there.
This is a very interesting story.
Where's the restroom?
He studies American history.
You have changed so much that I can hardly recognize you.
I think that Tom lied to me.
I continued working.
He was standing at the door.
Tom messed with the wrong guy.
I know you like chocolate.
I think you'll want to hear me out.
I'll come and see you later.
You are taller than she is.
I cannot help thinking that my son is still alive.
Who did you invite to dinner?
I'm all for that.
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
His high salary enabled him to live in comfort.
I'll drive Tom home.
They cried when they heard the news.
Welcome back.
They let me go.
They found it.
They're different.
I really do need your help.
His face showed that he was annoyed.
I gave the beggar all the money I had.
Never give up till the very end.
Keep searching.
She sold all of her furniture, so she could afford to feed herself and her dog.
They left it under the table.
I like to write poems.
We'll find it.
Don't take it personally.
Let's do this first of all.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
Turn around.
Why would I laugh?
I don't like your taste in color.
When did you do this?
Will you join us?
He was a disagreeable old man.
Tom attached the string to the kite.
How can you do this to me?
You're in luck.
There are going to be a lot of questions.
I promise you I'll explain everything later.
Go back to your seats.
He lived in France for some time, then went to Italy.
I'm not the one who makes the rules.
What's your favorite pastime?
I would be willing to help you.
You should take advantage of this chance.
All that glitters is not gold.
Please don't get angry.
I was born on the 31st of May in 1940.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
You can't win every time.
She took him to the lake.
It is important for old people to stay strong.
Football is my favorite game.
Is there anything you want that you don't have?
Do you feel like going out for a walk?
Why didn't you say it like that?
I'm used to no one liking me.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
We're the owners.
She looks very much afraid.
Would you like it washed?
Can you believe this is really happening?
I often look up words in that dictionary.
What's wrong with you tonight?
Is the sun up yet?
To make matters worse, it began to rain.
Do you like playing volleyball?
There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
Never tell me a lie again.
Have you told anybody?
She looked as if she had seen a ghost.
They kissed in the rain.
I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
Where are you headed?
I was starving.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
I want this.
Stop following me.
I really want to get this work done.
She solved the problem with ease.
Lightning struck the tower.
I need a hacksaw to finish this job.
We had lunch early.
What are you going to do with that?
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
The wind calmed down.
Where is the train station?
I thought I was alone.
Where did you get all those plants?
Tom tried to make Mary laugh.
There is a little hope that he will succeed.
What a strange man!
I can't believe this has happened.
We all missed the target.
I can't trust you anymore.
All we can do is wait.
I think Tom would probably disagree with you.
I'm going to let Tom respond.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
Books such as these are too difficult for him.
When can you start?
Cows are eating grass in the meadow.
No one ran ahead of him.
I'll need to check my schedule.
We debated on the question of world population.
What a ridiculous concept!
He's gone into hiding.
Get out of my office.
I asked him if he would return soon.
He chose his words carefully.
None of these cars are mine.
Have you seen my keys?
He stiffed me for fifty bucks.
The car crashed into the wall.
The Prime Minister has resigned.
We waited in the movie theater for the film to start.
I'm sitting down.
He loves me for who I am.
The new bridge will have been completed by March.
I didn't do it for you.
The volcano erupts at regular intervals.
He'll arrive within an hour.
How come I've never seen you here before?
Tom would never agree to that.
They found each other.
That's not our fault.
The medicine made me sleepy.
Do you want me to explain it again?
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
Don't talk about my family.
I think you should open an account here.
It's really sad.
I came for you.
We're not so sure.
I'm Tom's sister.
Corruption was a problem.
He's gone into hiding.
Tom couldn't help but notice all the beautiful women on the beach.
I'll get used to it sooner or later.
I need a partner.
She stood up.
I was happy then.
Can you wait a minute?
I had a good time during the trip.
Tom isn't very spontaneous, is he?
What's wrong with them?
I'm trying to remember.
I may try again later.
Have you heard the good news?
Come down here and eat with us.
In hindsight, this was a mistake.
This is my coach.
He had the right idea.
Please don't die!
All the furniture was covered with dust.
What do you say we go skiing?
They greeted each other warmly.
I am short of money.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
You have chosen the best.
I love to eat cakes.
I should've married your sister instead of you.
Tom won't talk about that.
The train was almost an hour behind schedule today.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
Whatever you do, don't let Tom help you.
That's a good reason, I guess.
It's your only chance.
Work slowly.
Say hello.
Are you still up?
I can only tell you what I know.
Would you care for drinks?
If it weren't for music, the world would be a boring place.
It was my destiny.
I'll send you home in my car.
There is no advantage in staying here.
Nobody insults my country.
I would appreciate any information you can send to us.
My legs are hurting.
Tom often smiles.
The middle finger is the longest.
That's not my decision.
Close that door.
Let's do it again.
I'm sure I'll win the tennis match.
The sun was shining, yet it was cold.
He bribed that politician with a great deal of money.
You've already forgotten.
What grade are you in?
She flatters herself by thinking that she is beautiful.
Her youngest child is five years old.
He felt himself being lifted up.
I figured you might change your mind.
Japan imports oranges from California.
I'm popular.
I think I've figured out why Tom has never learned to speak French so well.
Both spellings are correct.
The day was exhausting.
I didn't tell you everything.
Try to learn a little English.
I want you to stay a little longer.
He told me that whatever might happen, he was prepared for it.
I need to know if you are planning to come.
I'm a normal guy.
Tom is standing over there near the fireplace.
You don't need to tell me your real name.
Is this place secure?
Open these doors.
I forgot to tell them.
I want to write all of this down.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
He owes me a favor.
I negotiated the price with him.
Was Tom the one who brought this?
Tom doesn't even know my name.
He is taller than his father.
Has Flight 123 been delayed?
I don't like being cheated.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
Are those people terrorists?
Someday you should give it a try.
It's not a weapon.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
What's all the excitement about?
Do you smoke?
Tom will like it.
He is my neighbor, but I don't know him well.
He wants to be a tennis player when he grows up.
Tom asked the waitress for the wine list.
They are in class.
You must have thought of something.
Happy New Year!
None of these are mine.
You must do this alone.
I went to the hospital yesterday.
She's an intelligent young woman.
We live near a big library.
The papers got blown away.
Would you like some more cake?
Tom told me he was retired.
The experiment has to begin.
They said that it was important.
The doctor monitored the patient's heartbeat and blood pressure.
I want to prove I can do this.
I reached Nagoya early this morning.
How did you come by all this money?
I talk to myself.
You had better prepare for the future.
Few students know how to read Latin.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
We walked to the river.
I wish you had come with us.
Have you already finished?
Because of the bad weather, I didn't go.
How about we go for a drink?
Wait here. I'll be back soon.
He's the black sheep of the family.
Don't be so modest.
It took me a long time to get over my last relationship.
Get ready.
Please send this by registered mail.
You're in danger, too.
He had the nerve to say that.
Tom doesn't like to sing.
Tom seems to need to go to the bathroom.
Why is it so hard for people to understand that I just want to be left alone?
For the moment there's nothing in particular I need to be doing.
You do know Tom's lying, don't you?
This book deals with China.
I'm ashamed to ask you such a silly question.
Where are the car keys?
He is a nice person.
Why do you study?
Do you share a room?
You can't do both at the same time.
Everybody needs a hobby.
I went to the movies with my brother.
The army forced him to resign.
He hurt his left hand with a knife.
Winter is right around the corner.
You like classical music, don't you?
She bought six yards of cloth for a dress.
It has never been done before.
Duty calls.
Do seedless watermelons exist?
I am glad to help you.
I'll try to keep this brief.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Did you call the plumber?
You aren't as short as I am.
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
There's something under the bed.
He could do it.
I don't want to be lonely.
The cold weather extended into April.
I would like a room.
Lost in thought, I missed my stop.
Do you know why?
We picked the number at random.
Tom arrived first.
I had to be sure.
I think you're funny.
Our main problem remains unsolved.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the plan.
Do you want to give up?
All of them are good teachers.
I'm not busy anymore.
I must answer her letter.
I don't like coffee.
Can you take us with you?
They adopted the orphan.
I didn't know that you were waiting.
We've been disqualified.
He took a deep breath before entering his boss's office.
There must be some misunderstanding.
I'm not going to study French anymore.
I heard yelling.
You're too slow.
How did you manage to get Tom to help?
Would you say it once more?
I think you're nuts.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
The train leaves in 5 minutes.
I finally found a pair of shoes that fit.
Tom drew his gun and shot.
I don't want a gun in my house.
That's nonsense.
We have to find a way to get that done.
Sexual harassment has now become a social issue.
Could you tell me your name again?
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
Either they don't want to or they can't.
We have faith in Tom.
Tom doesn't know why Mary was crying.
He swallowed detergent by mistake.
We've got enough space here.
I know you have a girlfriend.
Did anyone see you on the beach?
Tom has until Monday to decide.
That child wants some friends to play with.
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
Go over the choices again.
I felt like reading the detective story.
I estimate that the work will cost more than $10,000.
I didn't know you wanted to work for me.
"Let's go to the movies next time." "What makes you think there will be a next time?"
I have decided to learn shorthand.
I immediately recognized them and so did Tom.
I think Tom was as surprised as I was.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
I can do it in half the time.
All you do is criticize others.
I don't want Tom to help me.
Start a new paragraph here.
Tom couldn't find work.
What's the message?
The question now is when.
He asked my mother.
The pleasure is mine.
I was fired.
Where's the closest pharmacy?
What time do you wake up in the morning?
You're very sophisticated.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
How is it possible?
I don't have time to waste.
What are they waiting for?
I'm not sure about that.
Tom saw Mary trying to escape.
I never go on vacation without my cellphone.
I doubt it.
Can we have a talk?
This hat isn't new.
The door's locked.
Tom and Mary are older than John.
We tried to cheer him up.
Sea turtles have a long lifespan.
It will be difficult for him to get up so early.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
You can do whatever you want to, of course.
The children got lost in the woods.
I just got an idea.
I'm looking forward to meeting you all after such a long time.
I explained the rules of the game to them.
I don't particularly want to do it.
I'm not sure why Tom asked me that.
Did you take a shower today?
Please fill out the Customs Declaration Form.
Please say hello to your family.
The man was arrested as a spy.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
Don't call her now.
Lend me your book, please.
That's a bad day for me.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Tom sat down and waited.
I still have mine.
He promised to help me, but at the last minute he let me down.
She advised him to come back at once.
You were afraid, weren't you?
I don't know anything about racing.
Look into my eyes.
I'm not selling you my car.
Tom doesn't know where Mary buys her groceries.
Tom wondered if Mary was as nervous as he was.
We were bored.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
The child is learning quickly.
I'm always losing my keys.
How do you plan to make amends?
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
I hate when this happens.
I will show you some.
There's no need to apologize.
Peel and finely chop the horseradish.
Go ahead with your story.
How do you like this town?
He seldom, if ever, comes.
Don't make the same mistake again.
Our kids are all tucked in. Now we can kick back and relax.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
I'm traveling light.
Come immediately.
How can I repay you?
The sea was calm.
She drives me mad.
I make it a rule to take a walk for half an hour every morning.
I don't speak Japanese.
I thought I'd be safe here.
You wanted this, didn't you?
We're all alone.
Tom is always working.
They're sending help.
How did you spend your vacation?
Tom is already in Boston.
Why are you acting this way?
I'll take the yellow one.
Let's stop at the next gas station.
He was driving the car at full speed.
I sure wish I could speak French better.
Give me one good reason.
I think you should stay where you are.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
He is known as a great painter.
I don't like to sing in public.
Tom made no comment.
Come off it!
I had business to take care of.
Because of the water shortage, I couldn't take a bath.
The kids are already here.
Everybody is waiting for you.
Everybody's happy.
She made a new suit for him.
He may come today.
Success depends mostly on effort.
Tom died of gastric cancer.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
I fear for the future of mankind.
There was something about that house that made her stop and look again.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
He can't explain what happened.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
You're very helpful.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I sent the parcel by airmail.
I'm only doing my duty.
Tom left about 30 minutes ago.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
Watch your speed.
Where's your passport?
Give me a table for two near the window.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
He could not believe his ears.
Is there another way in?
Please turn off the radio and turn on the TV.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
When were you thinking of coming back to the States?
How do you know what color it is?
Why did she need to send for him?
I don't think his story is true.
Stay right here.
You just have to ask for it.
Does she know you?
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
As far as I know, she has not yet married.
It was so good.
I think I'll take a look around.
Have you ever been to Kyushu?
I love hanging out with you.
Some of my best friends are policemen.
She just left.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
I can do it all myself.
Our success was due to his efforts.
What a pity!
You'll never want what they want.
The cat sat on the table.
I'm not entirely sure.
Do you understand what's going on?
I never loved you.
That's unimportant.
I don't need it back.
The police will be here any minute.
Tom said he wanted to help.
He is an aggressive person.
Tom's book was translated into French.
He told me where to shop.
I am not your enemy.
Everyone jumped into the pool.
They'll know what to do.
I paid the check.
One thing I've always wanted to do is go camping with my family.
Tom and I used to fight a lot.
I don't know how else to explain it.
You said you didn't care.
Leave this to me.
Tom likes swimming.
He was stunned by her beauty.
The soldier aimed his gun at the man.
Could you talk a little slower?
That's exactly what Tom said.
This was a big mistake.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
What did Tom want to talk to Mary about?
This sounds about right.
Irritating, isn't it?
Do you have a mobile phone?
What color is this?
The odds are against me.
Tom finished the job in three days.
I had to climb over the wall.
Tom died in Autralia in 2013.
He doesn't seem to care.
We can't kill Tom.
You have changed a lot.
What's the use of talking?
Pleased to meet you.
This bread is hard as a rock.
Let's synchronize our watches.
Did you plan it yourself?
Tom won't kiss Mary.
I wonder if I can do that.
Why would anybody want to hurt me?
Why do you call me that?
Someone might get hurt.
Please take a look at that picture.
I don't like dancing.
I can't do my job without a computer.
When I got to school, the race had already finished.
Tom lives near the ocean, but he can't swim.
Is your dog mean?
Do what he says.
How long has she been sick?
Do you know that boy who's crying?
I woke up at sunrise.
I can't explain everything.
I trusted him with the money.
I wouldn't ask this of you if it weren't important.
The train lurched to a standstill.
I got a letter from her.
Thanks.
Tom doesn't know what Mary means when she says that.
I should be happy.
I apologize for not replying right away.
Remove your hat.
They were very confused.
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
The bronze statue looks quite nice from a distance.
She plays the piano by ear.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
I ignored him.
When did you start writing songs?
We moved into this house last month, but we still haven't settled down.
The police have few clues to go on in this case.
It's very difficult even for a Japanese to put on a kimono.
You seem depressed.
A new road is under construction.
I like this model.
If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to let me know.
Are you a psychologist?
He is just an amateur.
I can hear you.
He failed in the attempt to sail across the Pacific Ocean.
You can rely on him.
Tom doesn't sing very well.
Don't be afraid to try new things.
Is there something in there?
You guys having fun?
She has a good figure.
These flowers bloom earlier than others do.
Tom wasn't wearing a helmet.
The average height of the girls in class is over 155 centimeters.
Not all criminals should go to jail.
How much does she spend per month?
I can tell you're a nice guy.
I can't believe Tom did that.
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
They felt many emotions on their wedding day.
Mary is extremely attractive.
I'm the owner of this land.
She began crying.
My father does not eat much fruit.
I've asked you not to do that.
I will go if you go.
Tom was a brave soldier.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
Tom has more money than he needs.
Tom sat back down.
I'm not all that smart.
Do you mind if I get started?
Several animals escaped from the zoo.
Unfortunately, the ambulance arrived too late.
I can handle this.
Please don't speak so fast.
Everybody wants recognition.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
You can't leave.
She graduated with honors.
I don't think you really believe that.
The meat has begun to rot.
Don't tell your mother.
He did the work against his will.
Since he didn't know what to say, he remained silent.
He abandoned the idea.
I want to be an actor.
I ran away in a hurry.
He lives in a cozy little house.
He wouldn't even look at me.
He is used to speaking in public.
Where's the nearest library?
Will you please let me go now?
The cops want you.
Are you listening to me?
I felt like such an idiot.
We're even.
It's a cliche, but it's true.
She is contemplating a trip.
She repeated her name slowly.
We're speechless.
I was eating dinner then.
None of this makes any sense.
He owns a good few sheep.
I don't have much choice.
It doesn't matter whether he agrees or not.
I have to go to work now.
They're weak.
I had to get back home.
Are we allowed to take pictures here?
Did you get the loan?
Tom is dying.
I can't stand this kind of movie.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
It's way too crowded in here. Let's go somewhere else.
You're not allowed in here.
He swallowed his pride.
I'm rested.
I took it for granted that he would keep his word.
We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late.
I feel sick every morning.
We all make mistakes.
What's this key for?
I thought I'd dropped something.
I felt like crying.
It's pretty light.
We'll catch you.
I think that China will play an active role.
Normally, I'm not afraid of planes.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
I'm looking for an old man.
You might be right.
Not a day goes by without our hearing of an environmental problem.
They're all dead.
Won't you go shopping with me?
I'd like to spend more time with you.
Come to us.
I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house.
How come you know so much?
Please pardon me for coming late.
The treaty was signed.
May I be of service?
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
I heard about the accident for the first time yesterday.
I'll leave this with you.
I've given up smoking.
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
Turn right at the second corner.
Do you think you would ever consider going out with me?
Put your hat on.
I am very sorry.
I can't understand anything he said.
Clearly you're not interested.
Have you fed the dog?
Tom changed jobs.
It's pretty incredible.
It's kind of embarrassing.
I drank the wine.
Get these people out of here.
Tom's funny.
He is distracted.
We feel frustrated.
They launched a rocket.
I did nothing wrong.
Thanks for stopping by.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
I wish to see my father.
Can you come to my house tonight?
I only want to help you.
You're perfectly right.
It seems obvious that he is sick.
Forget it.
He missed his flight.
There is a dog on the bridge.
Where's my book?
I don't want to wait that long.
Can you put the baby in the car seat?
I thought you liked me.
Check out what I've been up to.
You can take either book.
We're worried about Grandma and Grandpa.
Tom passed most of the time fishing.
The bridge is being repainted.
They don't speak Spanish.
What did I just tell you?
Tom bet $300 on the game.
My house was robbed while I was away.
Is there something I can do for you?
Do you speak Bulgarian?
We haven't yet decided what to do tomorrow.
I won't do it again.
Tom had blood on his shoes.
The job is almost finished.
I would never question his honesty.
Is there something in the fridge we can drink?
I don't have any friends.
Make sure you don't let the dog outside.
You are under no obligation to divulge that information.
This isn't an unappealing proposition, is it?
Tom must pay for what he's done.
You'll have to drive.
I don't know how to deal with this.
I think that you're mistaken.
He was jealous of their happiness.
I remember mailing your letter yesterday.
I wonder when they'll come out with a cell phone in a wrist watch.
If you tell people what they want to hear, they'll do what you want.
They have information.
We're still involved.
That's very odd.
I can verify that that's the truth myself.
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
Look into the matter more carefully.
I was arrested on the spot.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
I paid for the purchase in cash.
Tom's hungry.
We were friends.
My name is Tom. What's yours?
Does anyone have a tissue?
Do you have a pet?
I'm worried about my mother's health.
I think it's time to leave.
I plan to stay there a week.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I know Tom well.
I'd rather do this alone.
Anyone who can only think of one way to spell a word obviously lacks imagination.
Do you want to play with Tom?
There was nothing but an old chair in the room.
Pass me the salt, please.
He sat on the sofa with his arms folded.
I want to do what's right.
This isn't what Tom needs now.
All men are equal under the law.
He's a carbon copy of his father.
Will you read this cookbook?
Tom stopped at a convenience store to buy some milk.
Do you want to play with Tom?
Tom doesn't like to stay at home.
I am so sick.
Don't blame it on her.
No one looks busy.
Who's your date tonight?
One must observe the rules.
Just water, please.
Why does my dog hate Tom?
Tom does love you.
Did I wake you?
Shouldn't you be at school already?
The police arrested the suspect.
She felt like dancing.
What's your husband's name?
Who wants jello?
He was excommunicated.
This mail will be delivered tomorrow.
I can't show you.
I'll give that a try.
She's a belly dancer.
I'm not as rich as I was.
She's a girl, but she's brave.
I've got a friend who works for the New York Times.
You've lost your marbles.
The bicycle is mine.
I consider that racial discrimination.
Several students were absent from school because of colds.
The police kept looking for a stolen article for about one month.
When did you get married?
This tooth is loose.
Are you sure of your answer?
I don't like oatmeal cookies.
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
I'll call you as soon as I know.
There was no bathroom.
I don't really understand what just happened.
I just have a few questions.
You're right, I think.
Is there anything in this box?
He was deserted by his friends.
I didn't know that woman at all.
That's all I had to say.
I don't know anything about it.
I want to negotiate.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
We're trying to have a serious discussion here.
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
I know both of the girls.
I will try to do my best.
I often read.
I realized what was happening.
I don't like your friends.
My parents will be home about 2:30.
I knew we should've tried to help Tom.
A convict has escaped from prison.
The capital of Ukraine is Kiev.
I think I'll buy this tie.
I don't think Tom can deal with the situation.
You're not a loser.
He bit his lip.
I need to practice my French.
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
I promise I'll bring it right back.
Where did you get it?
I found it necessary to get up early every morning.
I gave her just what she needed.
I really am interested.
I can attest to everything she just said.
Do you have a blog?
This morning I missed the 8:30 train by five minutes.
I asked my son what he really wanted.
She said he would be sixteen next month.
He likes to live in Tokyo.
I'm glad to see you here.
I won't need you.
They absolutely detest each other.
Did anyone see you there?
That made me cry.
I was at your wedding.
Why don't we go ahead and start the meeting?
Some even accused him of treason.
What's that sound?
I never thought it could happen to me.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I didn't order dinner.
Tom's situation was different.
Is French your native language?
Let's give it a try.
Tom's response was immediate.
I'm sincere.
I couldn't make myself understood well in English.
I'll be back before you know it.
Who's at the wheel?
Come off it.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
Are you already married?
The brave fireman rescued a boy from the burning house.
We're not happy.
Have you seen my son?
You're rude.
I think there's something we're all missing.
I must go.
I grew up eating Japanese food.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
I am a fast swimmer.
Did you sleep all right?
I have no idea how long I was unconscious.
I'll do anything to help.
Once you have made a promise, you should keep it.
You never can tell what you might find at that store.
I'm allowing you to go.
A decision had to be made.
There are five patients in the waiting room.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
I have to be punished.
What will the neighbors think?
Would you like another drink?
We need to remember to put some gasoline in the car.
He will notice sooner or later.
He is my best friend.
I obeyed the rules.
Tom seems to be unable to interact normally with other people.
Not knowing what to do, I called her.
I meant to cancel your appointment today.
Did you notice her new dress?
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
I just want a vacation.
We could wait.
Listen to me carefully.
I'm wealthy.
Have you been mistreated?
I spent three hours repairing the car.
You almost died.
We'll have a lot of fun.
They're out to get you.
My shoulder hurts.
It made me laugh.
I didn't understand what was happening.
How old are you?
Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
Tom was the first boy to hug Mary.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
I refuse to listen to your excuses.
The baby was sound asleep.
Lend me a hand.
I feel like this isn't going to end well.
Everybody is sore.
Are you really sick?
It is very careless of you to leave the door open.
Without you, life is awful.
Tom isn't a parent.
I had to get away from here.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
He took charge of the firm after his father's death.
I abandoned my plans.
The demon lord finally lost conciousness and fell to the floor with a thud.
You don't sound very surprised.
People with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms should be careful about what they eat.
It's more fun than drinking coffee.
I want to cheer you up.
Tom is three years older than I am.
Do you have any cash?
Do you want to play with me?
You're not dead yet.
You look nice with your hair short.
It was not my intention to hurt your feelings.
It was hot in the room.
They're really tight.
She really looks pretty.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
The robber was nabbed this morning.
Is there something you want to say?
It was not conclusive.
You're really gorgeous.
He felt in his pocket for his wallet.
Tell me this isn't true.
I thought you didn't know that.
Something changed.
Lincoln was opposed to slavery.
I should congratulate you.
I think I'm right.
The book is small.
I'm armed.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
Was there a lot of traffic?
Let's make a phone call.
I have many talents.
Crows all but destroyed the farmer's field of corn.
I think we should be allowed to go anywhere we want.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
Are you certain about this?
I will forgive him out of consideration for you.
I wouldn't mind a beer right now.
I am sorry to cancel the appointment at the last minute.
Tom managed a small bar near Boston for quite a long time.
A guide conducted the visitors round the museum.
He also speaks French.
We go mountain climbing almost every weekend.
You don't have to sing.
Could you leave us alone?
She wasn't friendly with him then.
I can't reach things on the top shelf.
This is mine, isn't it?
I'll study French next year.
I worked really hard on this.
Did you watch the soccer game on television?
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
I need a room.
I wasn't hired.
It's inadequate.
I want a pen pal.
I don't particularly want to do that.
You're very wise.
You will need a bodyguard.
You've never told me that before.
Frankly speaking, I don't like you.
Who does this suitcase belong to?
There's nothing fun about that.
The pond has dried up.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
It is impossible for him to do it.
I get dizzy when I stand up.
I'm not the one who should go.
Did I give you enough time?
Hey everyone, please listen.
First of all, let me speak about myself.
The situation went from bad to worse.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
Keep away from the dog.
I don't ever want us to be apart.
I must say I'm flattered.
I'm not used to this heat.
Tom and I are no longer living in Boston.
I want to play cards.
We have to figure out a way to get out of here alive.
Do you know how to cook fish?
You're not listening, are you?
Where are my pants?
You're extroverted.
He solved the difficult problem easily.
The earthquake shook the houses.
You gotta get more organized.
It is to be expected.
Your dinner is getting cold.
He is in trouble.
I think you're going to find this interesting.
Stop staring at me.
Tom prefers to be alone.
What's your favorite radio station?
You just have to ask for it.
We don't need it anymore.
I'd rather go for a walk.
America is ahead in space technology.
Maybe it was obvious.
You'll be in trouble.
You can't park your car here.
He speaks ten languages.
Tom always sleeps on the floor.
He had a gentleness that was attractive to women.
No, you can't.
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
I have many visas in my passport because I travel a lot for my job.
Some students aren't going to come back next semester.
My brother-in-law is really egotistical.
I saw him once.
I won't miss Tom at all.
What's your nationality?
I knew you'd be mad.
Leaving something unfinished is the worst thing you can do.
What's your favorite food?
Tom certainly had something to say.
I've had a very busy morning.
When did you tell me that?
No one was in the car.
I'd rather she sat next to me.
I don't care about politics.
I like all my classes.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
Is this radio yours?
That's against the rules.
I'll call him.
I don't care about fashion.
How did you wind up doing this kind of work?
He said that if he knew her address, he would write to her.
I had to get away from here.
His father eats there twice a week.
You can take it.
It took all evening.
He wants to go to America.
I was wrong about that.
I really don't get you.
Tom never came back.
Do you mind if I join you?
I understand what you're asking me to do, but I can't do that.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
He combined two ideas into one.
Something has happened.
There's ice cream in the freezer.
It's high time you got going.
She could not get over her fear of the dark.
I like all of the songs Tom sings.
Please drop in on your way home.
They have enough capital to build a second factory.
He was going to leave the house when she came.
How's work?
All you have to do is follow me.
Do you really enjoy doing that kind of thing?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
You had better make use of the opportunity.
There's a restaurant pretty close to here, but it's not very good.
The city was full of hungry soldiers.
I can't believe this is happening.
I was horrified.
We often hear about an energy crisis these days.
You must study grammar more.
I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.
You raise a good point.
Is there water on Mars?
Can I speak to you?
Do you think I should go by myself?
Are you still interested?
I'm thinking.
Have you already tried not thinking of anything?
Tom can sleep in my room.
I hear from him once a month.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
We have no idea about his whereabouts.
We'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
The higher you go, the lower the temperature.
This broken vase cannot be repaired.
Please accept this little gift.
Don't pull the plug yet.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
Tom didn't come to get Mary.
I knew he would accept.
It's very kind of you to invite me to your birthday party.
I can do it myself.
What does your father do?
He hammered at the window.
Let me get that for you.
Is there a washing machine in the house?
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Let's have one more drink, and then I'll take you back home.
Can you leave the light on?
Would you mind if I smoked?
I would rather have tea than coffee.
I don't have time for boys.
How did you come up with that answer?
Everybody except me knew what was going on.
She walked up to him and asked him what his name was.
Clean your room.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
She skimmed through the register to see if her name was in it.
Dinner is almost ready.
Water transmits sound better than air.
The buses run every ten minutes.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
People will laugh at you if you do something as stupid as that.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
It would be too easy.
Judging from the look of the sky, it is likely to rain.
What do we have here?
I want to have a word with you.
He is the man you met the other day.
Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch.
I really hurried.
I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
I told them they shouldn't move.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
Save me some ice cream.
We all live within a five minutes' walk from each other.
You might be correct.
They agreed to start early.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
I hate all of them.
Tom and Mary don't know what's happening.
Tom died with a knife in his back.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
It cost me 50 dollars to have my watch fixed.
I feel like I should say something, but I don't know what.
The house burned down completely.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
He has already had lunch.
Be a good boy.
We want jobs.
It just was not my day yesterday.
I did all the work myself.
I don't feel like partying.
How did you come to know her?
How's the weather?
He had the ambition to be prime minister.
Run for it!
She served me coffee.
I'm tired of arguing.
I don't like to speak in public.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
I can't feel it.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
I'm indebted to you.
I just wanted to help the team.
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
I'm trying not to cry.
I can't imagine living without electricity.
I didn't know what to do with it.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Turn the radio up a little.
I don't think I want to talk about it.
Everyone's gone home.
Thank you for your understanding.
Tell us where Tom is.
That's what you've always wanted.
There is a right time for everything.
Pardon me?
He is worthy to be captain of our team.
I'm not going to disappear.
How do you know how thick it is?
Some non-native speakers think they speak the language better than native speakers.
I dislocated my shoulder.
Bring me a drink.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Have you seen my camera?
It's not as big a problem as you think.
You're the oldest.
The restaurant was quiet.
She asked me for help.
She likes to go to the library.
I knew we'd find you.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
I assume your mission was a success.
I don't want to go bowling.
Last week my mother came down with the flu.
I'm contented.
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
Read what's on the label.
The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.
He came to see me three days before he left for Africa.
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
Experience is important.
Who are you talking with?
Maybe you should call the police.
I know you're in love with me.
Where do the buses for downtown leave from?
I was drugged.
I can't help you do that.
Did we make a huge mistake?
I need proof.
Tom wasn't flirting.
An investigation is still pending.
I'm not very good at French.
I don't understand you. I have an earache.
He could not hold back his tears.
I was in Boston last weekend.
What's the big hurry?
You're not sick.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
What is today's date?
The captain gave the order to abandon the ship.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
This is such a waste of time.
Everything you've heard is true.
She cared for her sick father.
He wears a bow tie every day.
Where did all the bread go?
Which air conditioner do you think is the most efficient?
Did I miss the turn?
Cut it out, Tom.
Why are you so busy?
I've done many stupid things in my life.
I might not come back.
The shower is broken.
I can lend you some money if you like.
Do you have any plans for today?
The plane should have arrived at Kansai Airport by now.
Do your homework before you watch TV.
Where did you learn French?
The job is almost done.
We appreciate the advice.
I'll see to it right away.
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
You should be able to do this by yourself.
Honesty is a virtue.
What's the problem today?
There are many people trying to buy houses.
Tom bought some vegetables and fruit.
The blood stain can't be removed.
You need to be more patient.
Tom has a ten-speed bicycle.
They constructed a bridge.
You're not fat.
What makes you think that I'm against that?
Would you like to come to my party?
You're alone, aren't you?
You're not telling the truth.
I'll see Tom tomorrow.
I'm all yours.
Tom has started looking for a job.
Would you like to join our team?
Who is your friend?
I just want you out of my house.
The vase was broken to pieces.
I have nothing particular to say.
It's raining cats and dogs.
You are early.
I think we have some mice in the attic.
She can play the piano very well.
Father took his place at the head of the table and began to say grace.
The dentist gave me some pills for my toothache.
He risked his life to save her.
Look down at the floor.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
Before we say goodbye, there's something I'd like to ask you.
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem.
She attributed her success to good luck.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Everybody's having a good time.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
We must speak.
I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, we'd have been friends.
It is Monday today.
Why should I even care?
The noise was so loud that it was a nuisance to the neighbors.
It belongs to me.
Say that again, please.
He tried to solve the problem, but had no luck.
Do you like mine?
She refuses to say more about it.
What are these things used for?
We agreed among ourselves.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Don't ignore her feelings.
I talk to myself.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
I didn't really care about that.
He has a short attention span.
You can't just not pay someone for work you hired them to do.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
Why do you want me to wait in here?
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
I have to talk to you alone.
People don't say that anymore.
We must hurry if we want to arrive at the station on time.
I know that this is important to you.
I'm surprised.
I'm fine.
This car comes with an air conditioner.
I think everybody's happy.
Many people think I'm crazy.
This program is broadcast every other week.
We drove across the city.
Many thanks.
I'm at Narita Airport right now.
He's open and trusting.
Can I give you a ride?
The whole neighborhood was surprised at the news.
I wasn't very worried.
This shot will help numb the pain.
I can't stand his behavior anymore.
He had a copy made of this key.
He looked very happy.
Don't tell me you stole it.
I don't know who needs to do that.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Can I see you again?
Why blame just Tom?
Do you know us?
Do you need a ride home later?
She stabbed him in the back.
I brought that back from Australia.
This bird can't fly.
You may choose what you like.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
I think we're going to need more money.
Is your new computer working well?
How does this disease spread?
That's not our job.
Tom knows what you've done, doesn't he?
Light the candle.
How many people were present at the meeting?
I really do appreciate all your hard work.
They call each other almost every day.
Do you speak Esperanto?
Let's come back to it later.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
Your ideas are always appreciated.
I can't hear anything at all.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
The date of the festival coincides with that of the exam.
I chose to wait.
I fell asleep around midnight.
May I sit next to you?
You're the one that went crazy.
You have no choice.
There aren't any fish living in this river anymore.
I lost my key.
He is washing his car.
He was kind enough to show me the way to the station.
Do you understand what's going on?
We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.
I believe you like your job.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Put them on the table.
Tom has gone somewhere.
He lost his eyesight.
At least try to come on time.
I'd like to try it on.
Schools are closed for Christmas.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Summer days can be very, very hot.
That's too much!
The train will arrive at the station before noon.
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
I didn't tell Tom everything Mary asked me to tell him.
You're ambitious.
I'd like to look at that chart.
A nap would be good.
There's no free lunch.
No one seems to smile anymore.
In short, all our efforts resulted in nothing.
He's a successful businessman.
Brush your teeth after meals.
Take your time when you eat meals.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I need to get a stamp.
I was born in 1979.
They say they cannot compete with low-priced foreign products.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom hasn't played the guitar for years.
There's nobody there.
You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.
My father implied our summer trip was arranged.
I know your name.
I brush my teeth twice a day.
She risked her life to save him.
Don't be so impatient.
Asians eat a lot of rice.
He likes money.

I don't know where I'd begin.
My plan is still better than yours.
Do you have a twin sister?
I don't like your suggestion.
What time can you come?
Do you have an extra English dictionary by any chance?
I will sue you.
You don't seem convinced.

Tom didn't really enjoy studying French.
You are taller than she is.
You've got to hide.
What's the number?
You've risked enough.

You're afraid, aren't you?
Who's speaking?
Is everything all right up there?
Tom knows what the problem is.
Is there something you're not telling us?
The students disobeyed their teacher.
I really want you to hug me.
They stopped to talk.
Have you been to Kyoto?
Something wasn't right.
How did you handle the situation?

Call me if you find something.
I thank you for your courtesy.
Don't leave it up to chance.
He does it fast.
When was your first love?
Is there a timetable?
I was absent from school because I was sick.

I know what this is.
I know Tom is finished.
I thought they were wrong.
That cannot be denied.
I want to talk to you about this report.
She'd like him to leave right away.
Tom stole a lot of money from Mary.
She achieved her goal.
Let him go.
I am busy.
The news broke his heart.
There is a TV in this room.
I forgot to tell them.
My sister will get married early next year.
Is today your birthday?
Tom kissed his cousin.
You're not married, are you?
That noise woke me up.
We're all the same.
I'll go home.
I gave him the book.
Go outside.
Come with me to the station.
She's a powerful witch.
I appreciate your vigilance.
It was all there.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
I am so exhausted!
It was love at first sight.
They made me go there.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
How did you accomplish all this?
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I shouldn't have kissed Tom.
I think it's time for me to get a job.
You can say whatever you want.
Tom wants people to pity him.
Don't press the wrong button.
I want to file a complaint.
We had fun with them.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
I just want your love.
I love to help others.
I'm a normal girl.

Is there something troubling you?
I'll meet you right after school.
He was petting the dog.
The alarm rang and everyone had to evacuate.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
What did you do during the holidays?
Who's that person?
There's no need to panic. There's plenty of time.
Go straight ahead.
I'm getting pretty bored with driving every morning.
Did the phone wake you?
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
Tom slammed on the brakes.
Don't speak ill of others.
I've worn out two pairs of shoes this year.
We're about ready.
I'll stay with Tom until you return.
I took part in the contest.
I don't know yet.
Why are you so insecure?
Who painted this picture?
Everyone is doing it.
I never miss the opportunity to eat Italian food.
Let's go downtown.
I'm not a violent person.
Was this man threatening you?
He inherited the house.
Tom forgot to tell Mary what needed to be done.
I'd like to explain everything, but I don't think we have enough time.
I hate being photographed.
Why don't you love me?
It was a complete disaster.
You'll go far.
There is a lot of work to do.
I'm so sorry.
Your security guard wouldn't let me in.
Tom was appointed superintendent.
She was tired. However, she tried to finish the work.
She deliberately exposed him to danger.
I didn't have much time.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
Let's presume you're right.
Did you go abroad for pleasure or on business?
You're such a liar.
Tell me what else is on the list.
It's beautiful.
He is proficient in English.
Dark clouds gathered over the horizon.
Tell me what happened.
He took me by the hand.

It's 50 yen.
I felt very uneasy.
He had never canceled an appointment before.

I am not used to drinking coffee without sugar.
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
We don't have enough time to burn all these documents before the police arrive.
He is a good student.
Tom is afraid of making mistakes.
And what do I have to do now?
It's incredible.
She's the most popular girl in the class.
Does my dog look fat to you?
Minorities are despised in many countries.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
She asked him how to get to the station.
He demanded that we leave at once.
I am accustomed to cold weather.
He instantly fell in love with her.
I've seen this before.
We got there at the same time.
He is constantly complaining.
I know Tom better than I know you.
You'd better relax a bit.
I heard you paid a visit to Tom.
The door must not be left open.
What do you have to add to 17 to get 60?
Don't ask any questions.
You look happy.
It would be prudent to worry about the details now.

Tom has a lot of money.
What are you punishing them for?
He's skilled at videogames.
Tom screamed to Mary for help.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
He jumped out the window.
I'd like to borrow about three hundred dollars.
He made reference to my book.
I felt so sleepy that I could hardly keep my eyes open.
What do you want me to do with these?
The noise kept me awake all night.
You can go or stay, as you wish.
Can you tell us about your experience in developing technical materials?
It's the truth, isn't it?
He made no reply.
How many of your students are here?
I was threatened.
I want to go bowling with Tom.
I don't need it now.
That bicycle isn't his.
We're not the only ones doing it.
He was conscious of her presence.
When it was stretched, the material tore.
Which writing system is the most difficult in the world?
He is eager to please.
Can you swim?
Tom has really hairy arms.
It was a waste time for all of us.
I think it's very impressive.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
That's not even funny.
Put it back.
I know better than to be believe such a rumor.
She has small feet.
They'll let us know.
It's all Greek to me.
Would you do it?
I have something you want.
You know everything.
Do you have enough energy?
She thinks money and happiness are the same.
Do you have nightmares?
What are you good at?
You got what you wanted.
She is two years older than you.
Without your help, he would fail.
His girlfriend did it for him.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
He likes being surrounded by young people.
Bring a lunch.
I think I've seen this movie before.
I read several books last week.
She studies hard.
Everyone is looking at Tom.
Just use mine for now.
My mother is preparing supper.
It was a great trip.
I'm ready when you are.
I wonder what Tom is thinking.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
What is the name of this river?
Tom fell off the chair.
Is that love?
I've been sober for three years.
I love you more than anything.
Pay attention to the road.
I believed you.
I was relaxed.
She teaches reading and writing.
I'm stuck.
I've got something for you.
I have a Japanese car.
You're very wise.
I'm not a psychic.
You're a grown woman now.
I would like a large slice of cake and a cup of coffee.
I'm very happy.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
How're you holding up?
Young people tend to take things too far.
I know Tom can't win.
Tom kept singing.
Are you playing with my feet?
You will have a new sister.
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?
In case of emergency, call the police.
French isn't difficult.
You don't have to wait until the end.
She liked talking about herself.
When's the next shuttle?
It was a close game.
It took courage to do what Tom did.
It's not my problem anymore.
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
Put your glasses on.
Can you take the lid off this box?
Right now, all I want to do is sleep for a few hours.
The university administration lowered tuition.
Pandas are beautiful animals.
Is there anything else you'd like?
I recovered.
Do you want a glass of soda?
That guy is completely nuts!
What I can do for you?
As a matter of fact, it is true.
Tom won't ask you to dance.
I don't have as much money as you think I do.
My aunt has three children.
Keep looking.
I must have lost it.
I need to press the button.
Let's not panic.
I took the cake out of the oven.
Don't put your head out of the window.
I don't want any money.
How did you come to know about her?
He is now staying in Paris.
This morning I missed the train I usually take.
Close the door, please.
Which do you like better, sushi or tempura?
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
I shouldn't have to do all this work by myself.
Why don't you sing?
The addict died from a drug overdose.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
I can't see well.
You're really incredible.
Where did you find the keys?
Can you stay and watch the children?
You must pay attention to him.
You can give me the details later.
None of my friends speak French.
I bought her a new car.
We've been here before.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
We were at a loss what to do.
You were drunk, weren't you?
I made a complete fool of myself.
The conference ended two hours ago.
Well, you've convinced me.
I will be back soon.
Who threw a stone at my dog?
They want to tell you their story.
How could you not know?
Do you take American Express?
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
I am fat.
Look at the cat.
I am a teacher, too.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Tom ignored our advice.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
I may die tomorrow.
You'd better not go.
I wonder if he's really sick.
This is not very stylish.
Give me back my pencil.
It's warm here all the year round.
Have you been told where to park your car?
I am quite all right now.
As a result, prices rose.
Tom isn't really a teacher.
Don't waste ammunition.
We were alone.
He drank detergent by mistake.
He zipped his bag shut.
Get out!
I'm lucky today.
I know what those books are like.
That's all I said.
Throw it there.
You never told me that.
I have a few friends.
I'm drunk.
He was the only man.
I suppose you'll be needing this.
I could hear everybody cheering.
I have no idea how it works.
No, he didn't.
You are welcome here.
I don't want to know any more.
He looks very worried.
Can he do this job?
Do you know anything about it?
They gave it to me.
Will you show me the picture?
The train arrives at platform number 5.
He never saw his brother again.
That's not surprising.
Please turn on the radio.
I am from Spain.
Even a child knows that.
Guess who's coming for dinner tonight.
I think it must've happened just the way Tom said it did.
It reminded me of you.
Shut up!
Why didn't you phone before coming?
You can't leave me hanging.
That was unexpected.
Let's do it this way.
Is there an elevator in this building?
We used emergency measures to revive the cardiac arrest patient.
He got the job.
You owe me one.
The most valuable skill one can acquire is the ability to think for oneself.
Tom's a bright boy.
Tom forgot to pay his rent.
Tom is Mary's stepson.
I'll tell everyone what you did.
You should have seen it.
Tom gave me everything I needed.
Are you going to a movie?
I'm going to go to the doctor this afternoon.
No one ate the cake.
He left his son a large fortune.
How many brothers do you have?
You look European.
That's why I didn't want to come here.
It's a real challenge.
Can you get it done before the end of the week?
I love everything about Tom.
I brought you some lunch.
Perhaps he'll never become famous.
Tom wants to be a diplomat.
Everyone always speaks well of Tom.
Tom tripped over something.
They started dancing.
The recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous.
You must be cautious.
All the parking lots were full.
I may have something for you.
No one was in the park.
I'm not going to sell it.
Please don't be late.
I've never been very good at French.
Do you have the train schedule?
Did you speak at all?
Let's do something different this afternoon.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
He deals in furniture.

He's waiting for you at home.
What do I get?

Illness prevented me from coming to school.
All the buses are full.
I can teach you how to pray.
I hope to build a new house next year.
How would you like your coffee, black or with cream?
I have some news for you.
No one warned us.
Judge for yourself.
I'm very impressed.
Park the car in the shade.
You should turn off your cell phone.
Is it dangerous?
I think I need a little more time.
Spiders scare me.
It was effective.
How many audiobooks do you have on your iPod?
You look good in black.
How long did you stay in Boston?
Oil is extracted from olives.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
I hear you're good at French.
Don't walk so fast.
She saw him driving his new car.
This is the last game.
Five plus three is eight.
Do your parents know about this?
My father might be at home now.
Do you consider yourself a good guitarist?
The door was wide open.
I was threatened.
He loves taking trips.
Do you want some company?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I am swamped with work.
It was not my fault.
Tom thought Mary had died.
That was a good experience.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
You're not being rational.
I have got to go now.
We watched TV last night.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I can't leave work until five.
Nobody's forcing you.
Tom made a sandwich.
I'm buying a puppy.
He looks older than my brother.
You should have told him.
Aren't you embarrassed?
She lives in an apartment alone.
Tom, who had been working all day, wanted to have a rest.
There's still some room in the closet.
I have the key.
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
There is no breeze here.
Please tell me your name and telephone number.
Is everything OK here?
I guess that's how I'd do it.
I just want an affordable place to live.
Tom didn't listen to what I said.
Finding a good place to live isn't easy.
That dictionary is mine.
How many of your friends have beards?
All of you look healthy.
All his hopes evaporated when he lost his only son in the war.
I need you to do that.
She learned to ride a bicycle last year.
Leave a message.
The wedding will be held in a 17th century church.
Did they find anything?
I've run out of money.
Tom owns a lot of cars.
I got bored with his long talk.
I know who didn't do what they were supposed to do.
I thought you had homework.
A dog can run faster than a man can.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
There is a message for you.
Stop acting like a baby.
Are you fully recovered?
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
People are still scared.
Be serious.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
He saw that he was wrong.
I approve of your plan.
Who's your father?
That's the way I like it.
Please correct me if I make a mistake.
We happened to ride the same train.
He risked losing all his fortune.
Tom is ashamed of his body.
When I heard that, I started to cry.
Tom can't do anything about it.
The line is busy again.
Be careful!
Are you sure that you want to go there?
You have lovely eyes, don't you?
He wanted to teach English at school.
I want to sleep for a while.
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
Tom has been very good to me.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
Can I have this donut?
She was lying.
Is that normal?
Do you think I'm too old to go back to school?
Which one's the new one?
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
I need a bigger challenge.
The door opened.
The unexpected always happens.
You're fluent in French, right?
It feels like rain.
He died fighting in the Vietnam War.
I need colored pencils.
I have sore feet.
I'm happy enough.
We go to school to learn.
I know that Tom was early.
I don't know what you want to hear.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
Since I was sleepy, I went to sleep.
I don't like any of these hats.
Your car handles easily.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
We can't do that.
That sounded like a gunshot.
Look at that dog.
It is really nice of you.
I'm not creative.
I often read books.
The next station is where you get off.
Tom is always sleeping.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
I can't eat this much food.
I'm not married yet.
I wanted you to have this.
Please don't speak so fast.
Stop being so nice.
I led that mission.
Is it an emergency?
They're safe.
What was your favorite book when you were a child?
I'm tougher than you think.
You're very resourceful.
Tom wasn't so sure of himself.
He came to the United States as a boy from Scotland.
You'll be the first to know.
I might be back before you leave.
Whose turn is it?
He is a student.
I love you.
Wipe your nose.
I'm thinking of having dinner at 5.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
Are you going to eat those fries?
Prices depend on supply and demand.
Don't eat the oysters.
I did the same thing in Boston.
Do you need an ambulance?
Have you taken your medicine yet?
Would you please keep the noise down?
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
I know neither of them.
I guess you want me to leave.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
How can we prove that?
We're friends.
Tom wanted to be a writer.
I built a shelter.
This should be fun.
Is that a crime?
He's a Chinese-American.
Don't worry about making mistakes.
I knew you'd mess things up.
One's point of view depends on the point where one sits.
I know exactly who it is.
Why are you being weird?
You shouldn't be in here.
They gave us their word.
Are you ready to work?
Tom is Mary's hero.
He took part in the anti-war demonstration.
I barely knew Tom.
Is there a doctor on board?
I am not happy.
Tom and Mary were only thirteen when they first met.
It can be fatal.
Tom saw that Mary was busy.
This product is expensive to produce.
I have been studying French four years now.
If I knew how to use a computer, maybe they would pay me more.
A puppet does not know that it is being controlled.
He is strange, and I don't like strange people.
What department do you work for?
Climb to the top.
I lost my umbrella.
He will also go.
He asked for more money.
I'm kind of hungry, too.
I have to talk to you alone.
Science does not solve all the problems of life.
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
Tom had lipstick all over his face.
I'm just being honest.
I don't mind if you leave.
Are you interested?
He was the only one not invited to the party.
We have to do that this week.
Columbus believed that the Earth was round.
I let you catch me.
I felt a little dizzy.
She's a fox.
No one cares.
He is the president of the company in fact.
You were so strong.
Have you read the article about Asia in Time?
As soon as she got on the train, it pulled out of the station.
We'll try one more time.
Nothing is happening.
We have to get up early tomorrow morning.
I got thirsty.
Is your daughter blind?
I think you must be getting tired.
I'd say you're jealous.
They are afraid of death.
Why didn't it work?
I think she's innocent.
What was he doing there?
They agree.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
What have they done to you?
You didn't have any choice.
I plan to get a job as soon as I can.
It's warm in here.
What do you think of these?
Tom, it's not your fault.
I guess I shouldn't have done that.
I'll permit you to go.
I'll do whatever it takes.
When did you become a teacher?
Human relationships are complex.
He was the only one not invited to the party.
He's an author.
Can anyone believe you?
You're not a teenager yet.
Do you consider them dangerous?
No one else was injured.
Look at all these flowers.
Tom decided to risk it all.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
We can't go.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
We're like brothers.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Traffic accidents are increasing in number.
What're your plans for the weekend?
She used margarine instead of butter.
Tom isn't going to listen to me.
Why did you paint this wall black?
You'd tell me the truth, wouldn't you?
You must have lost them.
Could you get in touch with him?
Who are you laughing at?
I love you both.
I have to sleep.
Why do you like squirrels so much?
We must do it quickly.
He would not follow my advice.
I hadn't intended to work at this company this long.
Further investigation is required.
I made two.
That question is under discussion.
The bishop took pity on the desperate immigrants.
He is the stingiest person I know.
He never keeps his word.
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
I spent a great deal of time dealing with that problem last week.
I remember the letter.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
Why are you flinching?
How and when life began is still a mystery.
You are twice as strong as me.
I need sugar.
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
So what are you talking about?
It was your mistake.
Don't talk about work. We're on vacation.
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
I have a lot of money.
Do you want to come over and watch a movie?
What's wrong with him?
I don't notice any difference.
Are you up to the task?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
What happens after that?
I just want to rest.
When did you start dating?
I made that one.
All the answers to this question were wrong.
Tom got a job at a local pizzeria.
I've never felt better in my life.
It's a hard, dirty job.
It'll take some time to get used to living here.
You're very timid.
If I were you, I would accept his offer.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Tom can speak French.
At last, we got to the lake.
Aren't you late?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
You should relax a little.
It's awful.
Why didn't you do it?
In addition to that, he failed the examination.
He whistled for his dog.
I went skiing a lot as a kid.
I didn't want to give up.
How did he find us?
You're talented.
Tom wants to meet me.
I wanted to make sure we didn't cause the problem.
They don't have to know.
I'll need at least three days to translate that thesis.
It's on the sofa.
You've probably heard of us.
I own a computer.
You should always knock before entering Tom's room.
My foot hurts.
I hope I'll see you again.
You have betrayed us.
It's not an easy sport.
Why didn't you just leave?
Was that your question?
Do you want some help?
We looked at each other.
This must be my lucky day.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
She calls him every night and talks for at least an hour.
Tom made himself something to eat.
Are you happy with your new sports car?
She stressed that she did it by herself.
She changed her schedule to match his.
Why are you flinching?
According to the radio, it will snow tomorrow.
He does not like being punished.
We want to talk with Tom.
I suddenly realized that my watch was gone.
The patient requires constant care.
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
I have a truck.
I'm pretty sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
One of his two daughters lives in Tokyo, and the other in Nara.
I want a boyfriend.
He said that he would call you later.
I tried to protect you.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Existing legislation does not take diversity of races into account.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
We were outnumbered.
We don't have to go.
Let me do this for you.
Everything went horribly wrong.
She looked ill.
Will you do it?
The accident happened at that intersection.
I think you're cute.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He was angry with his daughter.
The military has a very strict chain of command.
According to TV news, there was a plane crash in India.
Look at that!
It affects all of us.
He hates air travel.
This mine will close down next month.
We want our money.
She might have met him yesterday.
Close the window before going to bed.
He looks nothing like a doctor.
He has a large desk in his small room.
He must have left the water running.
Thunderstorms are both scary and exciting.
Come to my room between three and four.
He's right behind you.
I can't read your mind.
We were back to square one.
I hope you two are very happy.
I don't even know where to start looking.
Is there something in particular that you want to study?
I got a message that you wanted to see me.
Some people are never content with what they have.
It's my left eye that's bothering me.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
I wonder what they're laughing about.
Tom didn't know how to respond.
Tom told me you were in Boston.
Tom drank a lot last night and is a bit hung over this morning.
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
Call security!
Can you believe this is already happening?
I love to party.
Why's the engine still running?
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
I heard from him last month.
She dumped him for a richer man.
I don't want to be chosen.
What're the chances that Tom will actually get the job?
We're both single.
I don't like your attitude.
You can't believe that.
He kept on crying.
Aren't you contradicting yourself?
How much did the tickets cost?
Isn't it sickening?
She is all skin and bone.
I felt tired from having worked for hours.
Which cup will he choose?
You two make a great team.
Sooner or later, every parent has to have a talk with their children about the birds and the bees.
It's nice to be appreciated.
What are we supposed to do now?
I need it as quickly as possible.
Maybe it really was an accident.
They had a choice.
I took Tom to the hospital.
The players scrambled for the ball.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
Sometimes when it's very cold, I can't get my car to start.
It's still mine.
Wake up.
At last, we got to the lake.
I can't show you.
I come from Japan.
He is a really good worker.
We celebrated Mother's 45th birthday.
Don't you think that's strange?
I stayed at home because I was sick.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
Tom and Mary both said no.
No one knew who did it.
It was worth a try.
I'm now about as tall as my father.
Don't leave this room.
How much did you pay the electrician?
The book is very interesting.
They cannot be saved.
She ran as fast as possible.
What results do you anticipate?
Maybe it was fate.
Keep reading.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
It was not an easy decision.
I often call on him.
This racket belongs to me.
I'm going to correct this.
I was caught in the rain on my way home.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
Are you going to be home for Christmas?
I'll be there in a minute.
How did he come by this money?
Why do I have to do this alone?
I had already left when they arrived.
The sky is full of stars.
His parents want him to go to college.
He warned us not to enter the room.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I assume that's what you want.
Whatever you do, don't push this button.
I feel a little responsible.
I had two copies of the book.
I did everything I was supposed to do.
My son is taller than me.
The elevator is coming up.
We surrendered.
I know he will only continue disappointing me, but I can't help loving him.
Let's start with the easiest question.
Neither of my brothers will be there.
Tom is on this ship.
Are you free for lunch?
I was afraid I'd be late.
It is no use talking with him.
You have changed since I saw you last year.
Nobody backed up what I said.
I wasn't too sure about it.
Trying to find happiness only makes you unhappy.
I can give it a try.
Please don't tell anyone else.
There's no exit.
I do not mince words.
I think I see the problem.
Is that so bad?
How did you burn your hand?
Your answer is far from satisfactory.
I've never stopped loving you.
You're not dressed.
Would it help me?
Nobody is going to hurt you.
I got you all right where I want you.
I'm no different than you.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
I don't like to be away too long.
Since it was raining, I took a taxi.
I could use a little sympathy.
We've been married for 30 years.
When did I tell you that?
Why are you being so negative?
He's not in.
Life is full of mysteries.
I don't remember where you live.
You are naughty.
I feel like singing in the rain.
They built a safe building for earthquakes.
He seems to make nothing of it.
The hotel is down there.
I'm married.
Did you pack any snacks?
Tom thinks I'm going to drink this, but I'm not.
Most people are very passionate about something.
Is there an information counter?
He's about to finish reading the book.
I can't give you this.
The bill was approved by an overwhelming majority.
I just heard another explosion.
People will talk.
Put an icepack on your cheek.
We felt the house shake.
What's your name?
Do you live alone?
It's not safe here.
Don't smile.
I don't remember ever seeing you here before.
Why don't you take a break?
Can you think of a better way?
I assume you must be a close friend of Tom's.
Come down from the tree.
I must insist.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
My parents aren't going to be there.
They'll be here tonight.
I'd prefer to not take that risk.
Thousands of people gathered there.
Don't tell me to calm down.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
You shouldn't always do what everyone else seems to be doing.
I'm thankful for sunshine.
That word describes it perfectly.
I don't have to be here. I'm here because I want to be.
It doesn't bother me to walk in the rain.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
Tom is a friend of mine.
This is very exciting.
I myself have never seen a UFO.
He noticed straight away.
I don't want to stop.
They're experiencing white water rafting on a class five river.
I just had a meeting with the new client.
Tom called Mary this morning.
I like being on my own.
Tom is old school.
I'm allergic to seafood.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
Their eyes met.
At first, they were all convinced he was innocent.
Can we rest here a second?
That sounds horrible.
Don't make me say it.
I wonder where he is now.
Where would you like to go first?
Poverty is everywhere.
He looks as if he were ill.
They manage to get along without much money.
The streets are clean.
I always brush my coat when I come home.
My father is too old to work.
Don't buy me presents anymore.
I'm going to be ready for that.
It's possible that Tom was able to convince Mary to do his laundry for him.
It's you who've acted inappropriately.
Let's have a serious talk about your future.
I don't need you to wait for me.
We never should've done that.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Do you keep a dream diary?
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
We may as well start at once.
After I graduated from college, I got a job with my father's company.
You shouldn't talk back like that.
We're all students.
The game's almost over.
Tom bought a new car yesterday.
Her hair grew back.
I don't need you or anybody else.
I understand the sentence, but I'm not able to translate it.
Mary is a very attractive girl.
I think that it's going to rain soon.
What did you do then?
He crossed the river.
It'll soon be three o'clock.
Get on the horse.
I had no idea what was happening.
Tom washes his car at least once a week.
This coffee is too bitter.
Are you ready now?
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
He could not go to college.
Your performance was very good.
She talked a lot.
While you're young, you should read a lot.
I'm starting to believe that.
How did Tom get caught?
There is no more cheese left.
Where are you going this afternoon?
He's not afraid of anyone.
I have to wash the dishes.
You're bright.
This invention will make you very rich.
I lay on my bed.
The boy remained silent.
I know some of Tom's friends.
I thought you might be interested in this.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
Coffee, please.
Do you know how to drive?
Spanish is his mother tongue.
Very few fat men have long noses.
I decorated my room.
How's everyone doing?
It's very dry.
He hung a lamp from the ceiling.
My father was an actor.
He was quickly recaptured.
Just keep moving.
I was just making sure.
Where can I rent a car?
Almost all the students like English.
I bought a magazine in a store.
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
I like walking at night.
He's curious about everything.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
Why are you scared?
I don't need your protection.
Our train is late.
That's why I called you.
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
You didn't complain, did you?
Where did you find the key?
The sky is clear and full of stars.
You're not interrupting anything.
Do they know about us?
Let me remind you of something.
He tried hard, but failed.
He tricked me.
I want to please you.
My class was canceled.
All right, everyone, remain calm.
It's still alive.
I had a horrible day at work.
I was able to catch the last train because I walked very quickly.
I'm not going to name names.
Do you really not know?
We have two kids.
How will we feed everyone if the world's population keeps rising?
Grandpa always said there'd be days like this.
He lives off campus.
Many people believe acupuncture can cure diseases.
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
Do I have to wear a tie at work?
Tom needs to leave early today.
I made a list.
It wasn't much of an earthquake.
I'll introduce you to the team.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
Where are my parents?
Let's go to a Chinese restaurant.
I had a nosebleed today.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
What do you think you'll do with your life?
It was real hard work.
I can't hear it.
How come you're not the boss?
What would you do if you had a billion dollars?
I hated history class.
Tell Tom that I won't be there.
I've been calling all day.
He has a friendly nature.
I know you did your best.
I tried to talk to Tom, but he ignored me.
Which student went out?
Tom seems calm.
Something bad was about to happen.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
He's an excellent kisser.
Can I see that?
How about playing golf tomorrow?
I have not seen him lately.
I work for a hospital.
Please tell me what happened.
I thought you were my friend.
It's personal.
That is why I am angry with him.
I thought I heard you.
I don't quite know how it happened.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
Do it yourself by all means.
I was born in Osaka in 1977.
I gave Tom chocolate.
Everyone seems to be nervous.
Poverty is the root of all evil.
Please write down everything I say.
That's him at the window.
He has a daughter who is pretty.
I'd like to talk with you.
It's ached before, but never as badly as right now.
Let me show you around our house.
I was careful not to say anything to make him angry.
Nobody knows that better than you.
It's lost.
He doesn't get jokes.
Are you the author of this book?
He caught her by the arm.
Don't talk to your father like that.
I had a bad stomachache.
They can add something if they wish.
You're charming.
Every country has its own history.
More than 10,000 people signed the petition.
He was the envy of his friends.
Do you work on Mondays?
That should be enough for you.
Don't be so negative.
Her eyes were full of sadness.
You can't have that.
Have you ever been on TV?
Tom is right behind Mary.
We found one large footprint and a couple of different size smaller footprints.
This hat's too small for you.
Three out of four Americans believe in the existence of paranormal phenomena.
Everybody tends to be lazy.
I wasn't hired.
I want you to come and get me.
Time is up.
They live in a house.
Tom talked too much and let the secret slip.
Don't be ashamed of being poor.
This is a big deal.
He is not always in the office in the morning.
We're not ready to do that.
Photography is now considered a new form of art.
There are plenty of rocks.
The crane, unlike the dog, has never dreamed of flying.
He assumed that the man was hiding something from him.
It's a family secret.
Luckily, Tom had some money I could borrow.
Do you mind if I tag along?
He is very mean to me.
Most boys take after their fathers.
Tom doesn't play golf.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
I don't like the taste of this.
I can't tell you all my secrets.
Is that you?
I'm not safe in here.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
Three beers and a tequila please.
That was a good concert.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
She wanted to return home, but she got lost.
You're better than me.
You need to be more patient.
Please remember to mail the letter.
I'll be right there.
Tom will say no.
A car hit Tom.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
I'm starting to feel better already.
Their teacher praised them.
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
I've got a new bike.
Are you sure everything's OK?
This movie is really scary.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
She took me for my brother.
Can we make one of those?
I can't be something I'm not.
I'll fix you a cup of tea.
She wondered where she had lost her purse.
I'll be around.
They all killed themselves.
Most of them urged him to take the job.
She has many dogs.
There were 30 survivors.
He is often late for school.
I cannot do without this dictionary.
I provided him with food.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
We know enough.
You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?
I'll be fine.
We're very happy.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Tom is very straightforward.
She fainted.
Go to bed.
I can't believe you're here.
I met the principal himself.
I don't think he is fit for the job.
I bought a book yesterday.
It's certainly a waste of time.
Tom folded the blanket.
I don't want a big wedding.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
Could you please tell me the truth?
It looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
Don't move, please.
She is more of an acquaintance than a friend.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
Maybe Tom will give me a job.
Alcohol consumption is increasing every year.
He threw a stone at the dog.
I wish I had time to do that.
Eating between meals is a bad habit.
I'm sick of meetings.
I could use a little sympathy.
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
I really need to talk to you privately.
I told her not to be late.
I thought I heard you.
I get bored quickly in everything I do.
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
I swear I never showed anyone that document.
I saw a dog swim across the river.
Tom looks sad.
It's a small noisy apartment, but it's where I live and I call it home.
My TV is broken.
That sounds familiar.
He turned the key.
We have a lot of things we need to buy.
You're ambitious.
Tom can't even read.
He wrote to me from time to time.
I thought I'd find you here.
How many were wounded?
All of us plan to do that.
Which way is the beach?
Do your homework before you watch TV.
I feel responsible.
Needless to say, he was late for school as usual.
I'll attend the next meeting.
None of them wanted to talk.
You're a mean person.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
He stayed at a cheap hotel.
I want you to talk to me.
This is my wine.
I don't eat the apple core.
I meet him at the club.
We searched the house from top to bottom.
Please bring the others.
He deserves to know the truth.
The policeman was confronted by the angry mob.
I knew I'd be blamed.
Every privilege carries responsibility with it.
It's exciting.
A lot of people feel the same way Tom does.
He ruled his kingdom fairly.
That matter will take care of itself.
I've been in prison for three years.
I appreciate your answering my enquiry so promptly.
Why don't you ask your boyfriend?
Tom was strangled.
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
His advice didn't help at all.
I haven't seen her in years.
You're doing the right thing.
Do you weigh more than Tom?
Please speak more loudly.
We're looking for some computer-savvy people to work for us.
We still have enough time to discuss it.
Can I see your driver's license?
We are even.
He has already gone home.
She kissed him on the cheek.
Where are we going for dinner tonight?
Do you have anything to write?
Do you know why she's so angry?
He has a square jaw.
You don't know where it is, do you?
She divorced her husband.
I'm rarely invited to parties.
They had to change their schedule because the train arrived late.
I don't think it's a wolf.
I'm sorry you're leaving us.
Tom is an intelligent guy.
The argument is rigorous and coherent but ultimately unconvincing.
I don't know any of those people.
I can't permit this to continue.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I think Tom is awake.
Mary is the kind of woman I like.
He walked on for some time.
I think it's time for me to accept responsibility for that problem.
I extended my holiday.
Tom seldom makes mistakes.
The noise kept me awake all night.
How did you get caught?
I still care.
I saw Tom going into the bank.
Give me a cup of coffee.
This is a long list.
Thank you for the present.
Why are you still here?
She has known better days.
The meeting was held here.
What will become of me?
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
He decided not to go.
"This looks pretty interesting," Hiroshi says.
Where's everybody?
What have you done with my bag?
Tom and his friends are swimming in the pool.
I'm no friend of yours.
I wasn't feeling very hungry.
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train.
I'd say you're jealous.
I cleared the table.
Here's some water.
Did you open all the boxes?
Does it make a big difference?
He is photogenic.
It rained nonstop.
She's out shopping for shoes.
How dare you speak to me like that!
What do you think of these shoes?
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
Plumbers are well paid for their labor.
You're alone, aren't you?
My mother has sold everything that is dear to her.
Tom certainly fooled us all.
Each state had just one vote.
I can't get my money out of the bank today.
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
The thief was handed over to the police.
I hope all your dreams come true.
Do you remember anything else?
I thought you'd gone and left me.
If I had enough money, I could buy this camera.
Were you busy yesterday?
It’s a quarter past eight.
Tom is always watching TV.
That joke isn't funny.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
Anyone can do that.
What's the tallest mountain you've climbed?
Can you touch your toes without bending your legs?
He thinks I'm jealous.
I'm well aware of the risk.
Stop pulling my hair!
I'm working for a trading firm.
The only way to know if it fits is to try it on.
Will you stay at home tonight?
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
How could we have been so stupid?
None of the rooms is ready.
She is very intelligent.
Tom loves playing the piano.
He will explain it to you when he comes back.
Tom could do with some help.
Thanks for your help.
Are you tired?
Very little is known about them.
I watched TV this morning.
She didn't want him to go out with other women.
I thought it was about time we all met.
Father bought me the book.
I wish you could come with us.
What you spend time doing in your childhood affects the rest of your life.
You're the only person I know who is qualified for this job.
Tom said Mary would come.
I let my sister use my new computer.
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?
We're aware of the risks.
Tom is three inches taller than Mary.
I had some fun.
Which one will you choose?
The issue is quite familiar to us.
I quite agree with you.
Let's hope that's enough time.
I'll grab it.
You guys can do it if you try.
Is he a friend of yours?
That sounds very tempting.
We swam in the sea.
Tom isn't afraid to do anything.
Mary ironed her skirt.
That guy is a crook.
A typhoon is approaching Japan.
I wasn't serious.
You should apologize for your rudeness.
I think I am overworked.
We don't know much about Tom.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
In these two or three years, he acquired a large amount of wealth.
It's worse than you think.
Black coats are in fashion this winter.
She spends her free time making dolls.
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
You want answers to questions you shouldn't ask.
Oh please!
I don't know your name.
He looks well.
You and I are going together.
Eat everything.
All share the blame.
Three were wounded.
This is an international community.
How much does that cost?
I'm not hitting on you.
The next meeting will be on the tenth of June.
I persuaded the policeman not to shoot the monkey.
The Union soldiers fought fiercely.
Didn't you hear the bell?
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
This is a very nutritious lunch.
You can go back.
Would you ever go out with a guy who couldn't sing?
We're the same age.
I am a stranger here.
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married.
I gained three pounds.
I was too stunned to talk.
This is my baby.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
I'm going to go out this afternoon.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
You can't give up now.
What was the score at halftime?
He is a teacher of English.
I think you're going to want to sit down.
I guess you're right.
It looked real.
I handed a map to him.
You look just like your father.
His childlike laugh is charming.
Let's hope Tom can fix this.
Stock prices dropped.
We're still shopping around.
Are you a registered voter?
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
You're pretty.
Can you help me to translate these sentences into Chinese?
Tom and Mary are looking for you.
Don't fret.
He is used to speaking in public.
Among the guests invited to the party were two foreign ladies.
Tom saw both Mary and John getting out of their cars.
He doesn't know me.
Disable the alarm.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
I'm 99% sure.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
The situation resulted in violence.
He told me that I should be more careful.
It's half past eight.
I tried to maintain my composure.
I know Tom is boring.
He pretended not to be listening.
How old is this zoo?
I don't feel like going out right now.
That would appear to be correct.
It's dangerous here.
You should help your father.
Armenian is an Indo-European language.
He is a sharp-shooter.
I want a lot.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
I am from Brazil.
Carry on with your work.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
She turned her face away so he wouldn't see her tears.
I danced all night long.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
I see no reason why I shouldn't accept her offer.
I'm resilient.
Please tell me what Tom said.
The suspect has confessed.
I can't wait any longer.
I was born the year the war ended.
What did Tom get you for Christmas?
I just want to cry.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
This book is missing two pages.
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
Father seldom comes home before eight.
Is there a woman in your life?
I have done all that I can.
I don't know how to express my thanks.
He drives a Ferrari.
Would you chill out?
You've got the wrong person.
I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that.
Give me the sword.
What does it matter?
I'm saving up to buy a new car.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
Go back to where you belong.
Absolutely nothing is permanent in life.
Stop me if you can.
I am an office worker.
Tom promised never to do that again.
It was just a passing infatuation.
Tom lives in a tiny house.
She seems to have left for Tokyo yesterday.
Tom can't do that.
They clung together for warmth.
I'm really concerned about your future.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
He acts like a rock star.
Why did Tom call you?
Tom had dirt underneath his fingernails.
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
He despises people of a lower social class.
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
What museums would you like to visit?
Tom intends to get up early tomorrow.
She asked him out on a date.
I like to dress this way.
Here comes our teacher.
She'd never been this frightened before.
I could have done it by myself.
I'd like to read some books about the Beatles.
Tom bought a house in Boston.
I am afraid I must be going now.
How on earth can you speak that language?
How long are they?
I remember seeing him once.
He was very busy all day.
That's why Tom and I were disappointed.
Tom sat on a stool in the corner.
We're persevering.
I'll be on my feet tomorrow.
He asked me for more money than was necessary.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I now agree with Tom.
I am forced to do it.
He is not married.
I've never seen Tom behave this way before.
You can tell me anything.
I rarely talk on the phone.
The twins smiled.
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
I need you right now.
I know what they mean.
She put it in the box.
Learning a foreign language is difficult.
I like your hair.
I can come at three.
The poem's rhyme scheme is highly complex.
Do you like surprises?
I'm going to stay there for about a week.
Do I need to say more?
Dad needs to take a rest. He's been working in the garden for three hours.
May I use the bathroom?
Don't be so silly.
Winter vacation is just around the corner.
How do you know what color it is?
I do believe you.
Get back to the ship.
If you can't come, please let me know ahead of time.
How did you spend your free time?
Don't ever call me again.
I'm still in shock.
The story is true. Only the names have been changed.
No one cares.
I work in a pharmacy.
He could not walk any further.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.
This is a book.
He cannot afford to buy a car.
It's a lovely day.
Tom knows that.
I want to be invited.
I get along with everybody.
I could've cried.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
I'll quit.
I often go swimming at the beach in the summer.
The movie we saw last night was filmed in Australia.
You're not fired.
A child needs a mother.
Tell me what happened that night.
I hope Tom never gets out of prison.
She was almost hit by a car.
I said I was alone, didn't I?
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam.
That's his.
I've got everything I need right here.
He has one dog and six cats.
How did the audition go?
It's not logical.
Can't you hear all the car horns honking behind us?
I believe that story.
What language do they speak in Egypt?
He knows a lot of people.
You need to wear a tuxedo.
Let's get down to brass tacks and talk business.
You're fussy.
It's not ridiculous.
Read what's on the label.
Tom didn't respond right away.
Can you pronounce these words?
He gorged himself on ice cream.
Tom told me that he was determined to do that.
He's a sophomore.
They did not give up hope.
I want to dream.
Simplicity is a virtue.
He got me some vegetables.
I followed all the rules.
Take as long as you need.
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
What subject do you like best?
I don't feel like it.
I got up too early.
Do you want me to help you?
I apologize for all the spelling errors.
Why is love so complicated?
He comes at noon.
She sat there in silence.
I heard him go down the stairs.
I won't make the same mistake next time.
She ran as fast as she could.
You're the master.
Nobody threatened me.
Who asked Tom to sing?
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
This road goes to the park.
I like having breakfast with you.
He had a book in his hand.
I got dizzy.
Maybe it was just a fluke.
Where exactly did you go?
We lost a lot on that job.
Let's not get carried away.
These are completely different opinions.
He asked me what I had been doing.
Tom is a politician.
Thanks for all you've done to make my special day such a memorable one.
Those are all important.
You're resourceful.
Are you hurt anywhere?
She has a small black dog.
Mary really is a very cute girl.
You're not fit.
We have two television sets.
Tom never really wanted to go to Harvard.
Do you want to go out for a drink?
Let's meet up for a drink later.
He unbuckled his belt.
I sell shoes.
The baby has been crying for a long time.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
It's time to eat.
We're approaching the end of our journey.
This bread smells really good.
He found a nice apartment for Mary.
You must be in love.
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
Don't tell me you stole it.
We discussed the problem far into the night.
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
He parties too much.
There are seven men and four women in my section.
Tom opened the balcony window.
I'll never ask you this question again.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
These pictures are beautiful.
Which shoes do you like?
Take whichever you like.
She's a professional photographer.
He got lost while walking in the woods.
Are you busy Friday night?
I'm not going, and that's that.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
We depend on each other.
Young as he is, he has a large family to provide for.
The babies are screaming.
How come Mary is going on a picnic with him?
I felt naked.
I want you to read this letter.
I hit Tom.
He remained single all his life.
My children live in Boston.
You seem to know everything about this.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
Tell me what I should be watching for.
The company wants to employ 20 people.
Our team can win.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Would you say they match?
Are we just friends?
The first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.
Open your eyes.
Why don't you take your temperature?
I know everything.
By the way, I think you're really nice.
Do you have an interpreter?
She has never danced with him.
Won't you come with me?
I really miss you all.
Where were you when I needed you?
She lost her locker key while she was swimming in the pool.
I can't figure out what she really wants.
She wore glasses.
Is that what Tom told you?
No one said anything about that.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
I can't agree with you.
Tom knows it's useless.
Tom said he wouldn't mind sleeping on the floor.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
I can't wait another week.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I couldn't lie to you.
His father had died of cancer 10 years ago.
Is it bad?
Would you like to try it again?
You can't make us stop.
Tom sang me a song.
I'm not at all tired.
Why go to all that trouble?
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
I can wait no longer.
I'd like to remind you that you're under oath.
Who did you have lunch with?
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
I spent the whole evening trying to find my keys.
I want a donut.
Our plane is thirty minutes late.
If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold.
We've got plenty of time.
It must be here somewhere.
I admit I was surprised.
He arrived here ten minutes early.
He is getting old.
Would you step aside?
I'm sure that I'm right.
They're here for me.
I'm not in favor of this plan.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't do that again.
May I call on you today?
I knew someone would come rescue us eventually.
Tom couldn't have done it.
It's brand new.
The negotiations have ended.
Don't change your mind.
I'd like to talk with you.
We were just about to leave when she telephoned.
I was very nervous.
He's not in our group.
I like watching TV.
She wants to go out with him.
Feel free to ask any questions.
Who brought this?
I want to hear from you.
I'm not going.
I'm the only one planning to do that.
We should've paid attention.
The smell of macaroni and cheese makes me nauseous.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
You can't be sure of that.
It's slightly windy.
Have you ever dreamed of me?
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
Don't you think you ought to write them a thank-you note?
Are there any books under the desk?
I was on a trip to India.
She called him.
Tom doesn't drink milk.
The council agreed on it.
I never told you to quit.
I may not get another chance.
Is anything happening?
Maybe you'd like to come with us.
Pay attention on the road.
My father cut wood with a saw.
Things got really weird.
Any further discussion is pointless.
He mailed a letter home.
He can drive a car.
I was delayed by a traffic jam.
You have beautiful blue eyes.
I think it's time for me to call a doctor.
Tom got up from the table and walked into the kitchen.
That's not what I hear.
I was there.
They know what happened.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
I own this store.
Let's do this properly.
Thank you for helping me.
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
He cut down a cherry tree.
I didn't understand Tom's explanation.
What do you learn English for?
I want to know who told you that.
That was very good.
When I was feeding my dog, I noticed that the gate had been left open.
I found my father's diary that he kept for 30 years.
She didn't want him to die.
There's a lot on the line.
She helped him tie his tie because he didn't know how to.
I can't do this work alone.
We saw you.
It was very hot.
Tom has some homework to do.
What did that prove?
How long will this cold weather last?
They wanted protection.
We intend to do better next year.
Tom could swim when he was three years old.
I can't imagine why.
I only wish I were able to help.
He's a short order cook.
What do you think caused him to lose his job?
We're finished.
My car needs to be washed.
He was surprised to find the great artist's masterpiece hung on the wall upside down.
You are very courageous.
I don't remember, but I wish I did.
Dogs bark.
She is very bitter toward me.
Why did you stay home yesterday?
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
Mother has been sick since last Thursday.
Unfortunately, it's not possible.
I don't care for foreign food.
I am exhausted.
I will make you happy.
Tom carefully opened the box.
Where did you find this?
I've been here since Saturday.
I was saving this piece of cake for you.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
Where's my razor?
They never found out the truth.
Tom doesn't want any part of this.
She treated him very well.
You don't sound very surprised.
You must not discuss this with anyone.
Wait a minute.
You've probably heard of me.
She was not seriously injured.
I'm sure Tom had a good reason.
I kept the $20 I found in the street.
How do you happen to know Tom?
I'm used to the pain now.
Tom explained the project to Mary.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
Have you been drinking?
It's time to make a decision.
She's a very interesting person.
That was so awesome.
I don't know either of the two sisters.
Children need to play.
Are you going to share that?
I'm no use to anyone.
I need to talk to you in person.
Today is extremely hot.
A revolution broke out in Mexico.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
They're old.
What can you see from your window?
I was very reluctant.
Where did you get this key?
I had to look after you.
I've checked the records.
He stood with his feet apart.
I didn't know Tom hated me so much.
Who owns this house?
The flame went out.
You've got the wrong guy.
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
Please be careful.
Tom disguised himself as a fireman.
Do you have renaissance paintings?
I hate to see you so miserable.
We're like family.
I know it's an experiment.
I hope you enjoy the show.
Sorry, I've got my hands full now.
He's my partner.
Where's the dining car?
They're in danger.
Would you be friends with me?
What time is dinner?
His name is known throughout this country.
Do you want to drink?
Just ignore it.
What do they want us to do?
I like cookies.
Many Peruvians have the habit of chewing coca leaves.
I can't imagine a day without you.
Dr. Hideo Noguchi died in Africa in 1928.
The dog walked backward.
She tied him up.
Could you give me a leg up here?
I think it's time for me to abandon that idea.
It would be a good idea to try doing that.
Her idea is better than yours.
Give me your money.
The price of oil is down this week.
We want to know the facts.
Please don't go home.
I do not know exactly.
You're not being fair.
I finished first.
Tom is genuinely concerned.
I think you know why I can't do that.
You're very fortunate.
Are they still looking for us?
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
Words express thoughts.
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
I sat down next to him.
You look like a lawyer.
We have a small table in the kitchen.
He has made me what I am.
Did you shoot Tom?
You've made that clear.
Are we disturbing you?
He cannot have said that.
I waited for him all day long.
Do you understand that?
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
Maybe that's the reason.
He left her all alone.
Why don't we talk for a while?
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary.
We're very satisfied with it.
You're not being rational.
I have an ever growing list of to-do items.
Tom broke up with me.
You don't have a clue.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
The days are getting longer.
My blood type is A positive.
I think we need a doctor.
I don't have to worry about my weight.
I miss all this.
She repeated her name slowly.
I love being right.
Tom's sweating.
My favorite fish is salmon.
Sit down!
He is much taller than I am.
They constructed a bridge.
You seem like a smart person.
Is his father a doctor?
No one spoke up in his defense.
I should've asked.
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
This water is safe to drink.
This is old news.
You know what you have to do.
I have a bruise.
"Is he seriously ill?" "I hope not."
I just want to go to heaven.
His music is too noisy.
I need you to see this.
Nothing is happening.
Everybody's got something to hide.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Are you the group leader?
Here's the change.
This tastes pretty good to me.
This is my first time in Boston.
They say she is the kindest woman on earth.
What makes you think that isn't true?
I ran downstairs.
Is all of this money yours?
You didn't want me to starve, did you?
Don't you like swimming?
It's a nice day.
Personal computers are very useful.
I played football.
She must care for the old man.
Tom wanted to die.
The children didn't seem to understand the instructions.
Say you understand me.
What do you think of his new novel?
You should keep your promise.
You're the love of my life.
I was watching television when the telephone rang.
The policeman aimed his gun at the man.
She is used to speaking in public.
The only language Tom can speak is French.
I'm not going to stay if you don't want me to.
He has a Picasso.
Are you blushing?
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
Are you settling in?
Nothing we have done today has gone according to plan.
It's terrifying.
He ran up the stairs.
His laziness is a bad sign for the future.
I know all of them.
We didn't know the whole story at that time.
That can't be true.
I checked the date.
He is a very imaginative writer.
There is an urgent need for food and water.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
They probably saw our ship come into port.
You gotta get more organized.
Let go of the bottle.
I would like to know her name.
What were you doing in that building?
I don't trust talkative people.
Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
She spoke in a weak voice.
Tom always goes to school by bicycle.
This is my sandwich.
I can't come with you.
The apprentice is lazy.
They're playing our song.
Learning a foreign language is hard work.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
I can't believe it's really you.
Tom is too young for that.
I don't know how, but you did it.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
Tom has a very stressful job.
Aren't you satisfied?
Are you happy doing that?
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
Tom doesn't speak French.
Things got out of hand.
I feel kind of sorry for Tom.
I'll be at home in the morning.
Which one of these boxes do you want?
We could see the lights of the town in the distance.
I feel a lot better today.
We were made for each other.
That's quite common.
A lot of my hair has fallen out.
Tie your shoes.
Let's chat.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
Do you want to stop?
So, are you going to tell me who you are?
He is very young.
I just needed some water.
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.
He is more clever than me.
I understand this.
We'll all be hungry, so be sure to bring enough food for everyone.
I appreciate this opportunity.
He had every reason for doing so.
I want this cat.
I watched television instead of studying.
She asked me how old I was.
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
Did you sign the contract?
He's so cute.
I don't have a car, but my sister does.
We're all here.
Why should we harm you?
I never even considered that.
No one said anything.
I can't explain it right now.
I must warn them.
What else was in the basket?
I know what you mean.
It was worth every penny.
I made a list of things I needed to do.
I arrived at the station.
I really like these stories.
Would you mind if I have a look?
Darkness causes many children to be afraid.
I think we're already too late.
Your cough worries me.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
She always has her hair done by a famous hairdresser.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
They kidnapped me, drugged me, and then brainwashed me.
He should have taken the examination.
I think you must be getting tired.
He has written two books.
He boasts that he can speak six languages.
Don't repeat that.
I thought nothing of it.
He is the boss's private secretary.
This building looks very futuristic.
This bus will take you to the museum.
That's so untrue.
A true love story never ends.
There's hardly any hope that he'll win the election.
They carried water in buckets.
Tom looked disoriented.
He's very open.
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house.
He dared not jump over the brook.
Our negotiations broke off.
I can't explain why it happened.
They like ragtime, jazz and music with a swing to it.
Where's Tom's office?
Is it nearby?
Don't expose it to the rain.
Tom was here just a few minutes ago.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's hard for me to talk to Tom.
I'll call you at noon.
That's just the way it is.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
I'm all out of ideas.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
The rich are different from you and me.
I thought I'd be safe here.
I don't tolerate incompetence.
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Did you have fun?
I thought you'd changed.
Are we being charged with something?
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
You should listen to me.
It's a large one.
That's really important.
He slept all day.
He isn't here, is he?
He ran up the stairs.
You're the leader.
He was a god to his people.
Can you do me a tiny favor?
We took turns cleaning the room.
Do you have a twin brother?
Why don't you talk to us now?
I think you knew my father.
They're in trouble.
May I go out for a walk?
The tree fell down.
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
I was careful not to do that.
The fire started in Tom's room.
They were cousins.
Never tell anyone.
Plants take in water from the soil.
He took credit for my idea.
I've never taught anyone anything.
She is always complaining of her job.
He's really selfish.
I want to make a good impression.
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
She advised him to go by bicycle.
Not everyone agrees.
I want to quit.
Tom felt his phone vibrate.
The apples which he sent to me were delicious.
If everything goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
He worked long into the night.
Tom almost never eats fruit.
My brother is old enough to go to school.
I'd like to visit Boston someday.
Did it snow last night?
Your hands need to be washed.
My dream is to live peacefully in the village.
I am familiar with this part of town.
I know you're richer than me.
Are you sure about the cost of that car?
I also gave him a little something as a Christmas present the other day.
Are you mad about something?
I never thought I would get married.
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.
What's your full name?
He visited a friend.
I decided not to eat.
I want to do this on my own.
His car soon went out of sight.
Houses built with wood burn more easily than houses built out of stone.
I was fined thirty dollars for speeding.
This one is a lot easier.
I wonder if he will come.
I'm delighted to be here.
Could you keep an eye on my suitcase for a few minutes?
There is no telling what will happen tomorrow.
Tom likes classical music.
I don't mind.
I'm here to apologize.
Tom is about as tall as Mary.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
Please translate this Japanese text into French.
I want to talk to you after class.
Would you be so kind as to lend me your book?
This is a very scary moment.
We don't want to do anything hasty.
This is a very time-consuming task.
You're very sophisticated.
You don't belong here.
What are you doing with these dolls?
She fainted when she saw blood.
I'll help you as much as I can.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Cockroaches hide themselves during the day.
He is not aggressive enough to succeed in business.
Your watch gains time.
We're almost there.
He dedicated himself to research.
I'll be staying here for another three days.
I'd prefer not to take that risk.
That's all I have.
Go have some fun.
I want you to come right over.
Who won?
I think it wouldn't be too hard to come up with a better system.
I know what they're doing.
I must pass this exam, no matter what.
May I ask you something?
Old people deserve respect.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's the remote?
He was taken care of by a certain young doctor.
Bite your tongue.
I didn't think you'd show up.
I really had to run for it to catch the train.
He removed his shirt.
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
Did you have fun last night?
I'm very upset.
The lights went out.
Where are they from?
I'm afraid not.
Some people think eating at home is better for you than eating out.
Somebody killed Tom.
I'm writing a book.
Is Tom jealous?
He feels weak after his illness.
I cross the railroad tracks every morning.
My parents told me that we should respect the elderly.
That doesn't mean I can stay.
She stared at him and that made him very nervous.
That's all I wanted to hear.
It's more interesting to travel alone than to go on a group tour.
You're not the only Canadian here.
You're so sweet.
When did your daughter come of age?
Hey, be careful with that!
Let's ask the teacher.
This message is for Tom.
He's not going.
I went camping with my family.
Tom has many toys.
You did not come to school yesterday.
I paid for the damage.
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
What he said is not true.
I found this under your bed.
How could you say that?
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
What is your idea of a good time?
I don't like this tie. Show me a better one.
He said he would give us his decision for sure by Friday.
They're here until the end of the week.
If it's all right with you, I'd like to stay for a while longer.
I didn't ask you to do that.
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
The cat crossed the street.
Is your daughter blind?
You will not be able to catch the train.
I'm tidy.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
He picked up a butterfly between his thumb and forefinger.
We've been trying to reach Tom for three days.
Everything here is mine.
I gave careful consideration to the problem.
Am I under suspicion?
Unless I leave right away, I'll be late for my appointment.
I already have a bus ticket.
Do you have a pen?
You're very sick.
Please do not kill me.
Tom opened a window.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
I wonder if this is really true.
If you behave like a lackey, you'll be treated like a lackey.
I kind of like this place.
I'm really not busy.
We eat many kinds of food.
Tom didn't know where Mary had gone skiing.
Aren't you a little young for this position?
His health is improving little by little.
I'm very sleepy.
I really have nothing else to say.
What is it you do for a living?
You know I'm older than you are.
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
We haven't decided yet.
They did the right thing.
Tom went back to his own room and lay down.
He survived the accident.
Let's get out while we can.
He is in poor health.
That's too expensive.
Who forced you to do that?
How many people are in your crew?
Have you tried it before?
Water the plants.
Can I count on you?
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I can't take any more of this.
I'm ashamed because I acted foolishly.
We all breathed a sigh of relief.
She does not like him.
We're all safe.
He wants more.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
Where is your luggage?
We are the same age, but different heights.
Could you do that?
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
In Massachusetts, a man is not allowed to marry his wife's grandmother.
All journeys begin with a first step.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
I've never felt like this before.
He is a man of vision.
Who was there last night?
I have to warn him.
Tom is three years older than me.
I'm glad you're all right.
High fructose corn syrup is found in about everything you eat these days.
I'll come into the office early tomorrow.
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table.
Nothing can change that.
The more you learn, the more you want to.
History is not his major subject.
Can it wait another hour?
She told him her age.
I require your advice.
I didn't know Tom could sing so well.
My parents forbade me to see Tom again.
I don't feel like partying.
You're eating like you haven't eaten anything all day.
When are you coming to the Netherlands?
I felt embarrassed at first.
I hate math most of all.
I told you I'm not hungry.
I hope Tom and Mary don't get arrested.
I have to convince people to do that.
Why has the train stopped?
He is more clever than I am.
Do you enjoy losing?
Italian isn't difficult.
You are a workaholic.
Use them all.
He is no longer in business.
What is this letter?
Let in some fresh air.
Give me half of it.
I felt naked.
He is generous with his money.
Could you tell me your name again?
She'd just begun to read the book when someone knocked on the door.
We must tell him about it.
You're fascinating.
You're very good.
Tom used to play soccer.
All you care about is money.
I'll give it my best shot.
That's not what happened here.
So how mad are you?
Keep in touch!
You can't stay in here all day.
Tom has no money at all.
Do they have a computer?
Do you know him, by any chance?
After I had done my homework, I went to bed.
I should've taken that more seriously.
We talked about what we could do.
You might meet him.
Today is not your day.
He was sentenced to prison.
You have to be flexible.
Did you talk to your wife?
He struck a match, but quickly put it out.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
After the Christmas party was over, we all went out caroling.
I'm optimistic.
I don't want to discuss it.
Is everything ready?
I had to go back.
If I had my way, you would all be fired.
He is flying to Paris tomorrow.
Is there something you want to tell me?
You don't sound very confident.
They do that sometimes.
You are big.
Tokyo is the capital of Japan.
We all have kids.
Tom wanted to turn over a new leaf.
That's exactly what he said.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
I want some potatoes.
He looks exactly like his brother.
I'm not narrow-minded.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
He put a hand gently on her shoulder.
He had to reduce the price of his wares.
We'll pass.
Face facts!
He is twice as old as she is.
You can trust him.
What did you learn?
Everyone started clapping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sick.
I can't make ends meet now.
I'm not bitter.
I have not seen him since.
Where did you put the book I was reading?
There's a lot of chit-chat.
Do you have time the day after tomorrow?
You can't cling to the past.
He says that he has no memory of the evening.
I can't talk right now. I need to go.
My sister is bugging me.
I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
You gotta get more organized.
He has been sick for a long time.
The picnic lasted all day.
He tore the photographs into pieces.
I'll buy a book for Tom.
Tom is ready to begin.
None of the victims' names have been released.
You're very rude.
His attempt to escape was successful.
What would the world do without tea?
I'm not your daughter.
His story sounds true.
As a last resort, read the instructions.
What are you trying to prove?
She has a pretty face.
If you want to, we'll go.
I don't really want to go there by myself.
Just get off the stage.
I don't really understand it.
He will soon be a father.
We're very different.
You seem very nervous this morning.
How should I respond?
I want time instead of money.
What part of Australia are you from?
I live in Milan.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
This knife was very useful to me.
Tom easily guessed Mary's password.
They made me go there.
I have it.
Give me a hand.
You must hurry up.
Did anyone see you on the beach?
Just do your job.
I'm not in the office today.
A third of the earth's surface is desert.
I can survive.
I'll cover for you.
I am totally confused.
When was the last time you saw her?
Tom makes everyone nervous.
England and France are separated by the English Channel.
You're kidding!
The minimum wage in Okinawa is 642 yen per hour.
Even after twelve months, Tom can't accept that it's over between him and Mary.
You're free to go.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
He said, "So long, my friends," and left us.
The north wind blew all day.
His lackadaisical attitude to studying explains his poor grades.
I want to know what's going on.
The tree fell down.
I'd like to help you.
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
I just want to make it up to you.
I should've listened to Tom more closely.
The windows were already open when I got here.
You must be out of your mind.
Your dream may come true at any moment.
I have to talk to you alone.
I want to ask you something.
You've got to tell Tom how you feel.
He is a lovable person.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Please say hello to your parents.
Tom probably bought it with the money his father gave him.
I saw him cross the road.
Tom is friendly to everyone.
They're staring at you.
Did you learn to swim when you were a child?
She persuaded him to do it.
Tom wanted it.
It's a complete sham.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
We were winning.
This book is boring.
Americans have the right to bear arms.
So, what do you guys want to do tonight?
I think about them often.
Let me see your health insurance certificate.
Is Tom safe?
He is precious to us.
I really don't want to disappoint Tom.
Read what's on the label.
He got bored after fifteen minutes.
I'm a very lucky man.
Playing tennis is fun.
There's something about this translation that isn't quite right.
Have we ever met before?
Free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny.
Tom got special treatment.
Do we have a deal here?
We have different points of view.
Could you bring me a pillow and blanket, please?
A storm confined them to the house.
Get a good night's sleep.
You're the one who trained me.
Come outside with me.
You're the most intelligent person I know.
Was I really boring?
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
Our server will be offline on October 20th for scheduled maintenance.
You're invited.
Is she your sister?
You are so childish sometimes.
The world population grows by close to eight million per year.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
There you are.
What did they want?
I've got something in the oven.
Put some clothes on.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I was just wondering what kind of pets you have at home.
Keep singing.
Does that make you angry?
Doesn't that car look familiar?
I can't come with you.
Both Tom and Mary have already eaten.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
I asked Mary to dance with me.
He is said to have been very poor when he was young.
I'm tired of everything.
My house is built of wood.
I don't speak Catalan.
I've never done that before.
My approach is different.
Is bungee jumping frightening or fun?
He was standing at the street corner.
Let me say a few words by way of apology.
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
He did a good job.
It's going to explode!
Draw me a sheep.
I hate to waste my time.
The statue's head is missing.
He got the job.
Tom was afraid that they'd lock him up and throw away the key.
She seems to be unhappy.
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
He wears glasses.
I didn't say I liked it.
He caused his parents a lot of anxiety.
I want something cold to drink.
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
You're very timid.
We have to do better next time.
I think you did a good job.
You won't believe who sat down next to me.
He is a lazy student.
How old was Tom when he started talking?
Do you like the new school better?
How fast can you do it?
All we can do is to wait for him.
Everyone thinks we're a couple.
I never thought I would do that.
We'll do it together.
Why did you buy such an expensive dictionary?
Can you introduce me to a lawyer who speaks French?
I was worried.
I'm in danger.
Please prepare for the trip.
That'll make me happy.
I can't really do that.
Tom had his wallet stolen while he was in Boston.
My younger sister got married in her teens.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
Have you ever been to New York?
I think you should check under the bed.
What foods do you avoid eating?
I like the colors.
It's up to you to decide whether or not to go.
He fetched some water from the well.
What was her answer to your proposal?
Everyone in my family is happy.
You should ask Tom what happened.
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
We have a lot of work to do.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
I never wanted to compete with you.
She married young.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
You seem like a very smart person.
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
I didn't steal it.
Tom waited more than an hour.
I was searching for food.
Does Tom really deserve to be punished?
She gazed at me for a long time.
I need guidance.
The car's antenna is built into the windshield.
I don't think he's playing with a full deck.
What gave me away?
I think it's very nice.
Although her house is nearby, I seldom see her.
You must not say it.
Let me know as soon as he comes.
Let me do it my way.
Do you take me for a complete beginner?
Let's cross here.
Maybe you got the date wrong.
He doesn't understand sarcasm.
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I bet you're busy.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
We look forward to working more closely with you in the future.
The kids are disappointed.
Drink more water.
It's hard to understand you.
I'm feeling hungry.
You should be more careful.
He was the kind of kid who was always showing off to his classmates.
Why aren't you doing your homework?
Tom had to leave.
They'll think of something.
Tom can be very charming.
I know there are others.
I haven't eaten for many days.
My wife beats me.
Tom didn't know how to respond.
I said "good night" to my parents and went to bed.
Nothing is impossible for God.
There's some leftover food in the fridge.
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
Did you steal that car?
Rest here for a bit.
The baby stopped crying.
Tell me about it!
Please explain how to get there.
Don't forget to write to us.
The old man narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
Turn left at the first light.
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary was hungry.
I'm not the problem.
I just want to go home and sleep.
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does.
Plan for the future because that's where you are going to spend the rest of your life.
I often make mistakes.
I never go anywhere.
This winter has been mild.
He's too trusting.
I don't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
If you had asked me to marry you, I would have said yes.
Put me through to the boss, please.
I'm no saint.
Come up here.
They're just rich kids.
Everybody's happy.
I am engaged in AIDS research.
We were captured.
I'd like you to cut my hair.
I won't hold it against you.
Nobody's perfect.
I'm trying something new.
I'm not worried about him.
Monopoly is a popular game for families to play.
I want to know who started it.
This is acceptable.
My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English.
How did I let this happen?
Your room is very big.
Don't slam the door.
Tom is still alive.
We talked for thirty minutes.
You're not as good as you think you are.
That brown hat is old.
People came to like her paintings.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
She sounded mad.
As the date of the wedding approached, Tom started having second-thoughts.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
Where are Tom's keys?
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
He took out one egg.
I took the liberty of calling her.
I assume you've heard from Tom.
He can speak a little English.
Tom cheats.
Kids are smarter than you think.
Humor me.
As a matter of fact, I dislike him.
I can't excuse her.
Give me a kiss.
I was tempted.
The museum is closed on Mondays.
You've got a black eye.
She went to Italy to study music.
Why do you say that?
Tom knows he has no chance of winning.
The soldiers on the boats would be easy targets.
They're taking Mary to the emergency room.
The old man is always accompanied by his grandson.
Tom sucked his thumb until he was three.
I'm very happy with my new car.
How did Tom blow it?
I will go and take a look at the house.
Memorize it.
Life ain't easy.
It's never too late to learn.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
She taught me so many interesting things.
I'm in bed.
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
I didn't break the law.
Buy the dress you want.
War doesn't make anybody happy.
He doesn't have a computer.
I speak French better than I speak English.
Don't you want to be in love again?
Come on, drinks are on me.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
You should really lay off that. It'll ruin your health.
Give me three pieces of salmon.
Tie your shoe.
I figured Tom would never find it.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain, but he plans to carry an umbrella just in case.
Why don't you just study a little harder?
He's at her side.
I don't care.
I hear the phone.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
That can happen.
The honeymoon is over.
At any rate, I hope you can come.
I'm not convinced.
We complement each other.
They are Christians.
Tom doesn't even let his daughter go out on weekends.
Tom knew deep down that it was all his fault, but he wasn't about to admit it.
I often look up words in that dictionary.
I don't like big dogs.
I don't want your business.
Has Tom always been fat?
Are you happy?
The students of this school are kind.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
I refuse to accept that.
I can't do that either.
He inherited the house.
She asked him to come into her house.
This music is terrible.
I need someone who can speak French.
What's that disgusting smell?
No one was there.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
Please promise you'll never do that again.
She married an American GI after the war.
Ask anyone.
I ran away.
I haven't seen you in ages.
Blame it on the weather.
You will need a bodyguard.
I called you.
That isn't big enough.
Tom wants me to apologize.
I'm a salesman.
Don't put me in the same class with them.
Never give up.
This old book is worth 50,000 yen.
Shall we walk or drive?
The noise is going to wake the baby.
Get me the details.
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
What happened exactly?
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Are you still afraid?
Quit acting like a child.
You're worried, aren't you?
You really are pathetic.
Who will help me?
Tom has excellent reflexes.
I began to sing when I was a youngster.
A pick is a long handled tool used for breaking up hard ground surfaces.
I neither smoke nor drink.
Don't make me laugh!
He's very protective.
What floats your boat?
You'd better get up early.
You don't know that.
He had a traffic accident on his way to school.
That's kind of rude.
No one lives in that building anymore.
See what happens when you give people advice?
I didn't want to wake you.
Hey, wait up!
I fell in love in an unlikely place.
I'm your best friend.
Can you handle it?
He seldom writes to his father.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
You said you were going to handle it.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
You have to take a shower.
It is raining all the time.
Tell us a joke.
What made you come here so early?
I suppose you want to ask me where I've been.
Tom is guilty.
He likes to talk about himself.
I'll start with a beer.
Stop acting like a child.
She's eating for two.
We all know Tom.
No one knew it.
You are entitled to your opinion.
He lives in a posh apartment near Central Park.
I'm nothing but a poor peasant.
You'll be fine.
It's all here.
This book isn't very good.
How did Tom get caught?
I just got that.
The crowd got out of control and broke through the fence.
History is more complex than you think.
I was jealous of you.
She became rich by virtue of hard work and good business sense.
They are all college students.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
Tom is falling asleep.
I don't agree with this.
Where's the bag?
I know Tom will be supportive.
His aunt's apple pie was delicious and he had a second helping.
I had a dream about you last night.
We'll talk about it later.
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
He continued doing it.
Try to make it last a little longer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
I had to make a choice.
I don't work like that.
We won't let that happen.
I was with Tom from 8:30 to 2:30.
Take a bite.
World War II ended in 1945.
You'll get over it.
That's not quite right.
Do you have a question?
Say which you would like.
Do you want to sleep on the couch?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
Let me take your coats.
I did everything right.
Quit bothering me.
Come help me.
Fasten your seat belt.
She is really a nice girl.
That's a nice rack of pork chops.
I still have a few options.
He's ready to go.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
Do you know what Tom does in his free time?
We waste a lot of time.
Look at the size of that thing!
What he said may well be true.
What an attractive woman!
Cut the red wire.
All of my relatives are taller than me.
The boy is tall for his age.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
Everybody knows who you are.
Take the garbage out.
Tom made quite a lot of money in his twenties.
Tom didn't leave me any choice.
This is Room 839.
We can't trust anyone now.
My daughter is to get married in June.
We bought some new furniture.
I do not like the house.
My fingers are so numb with cold that I can't play the piano.
I have bad news for you.
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
What have you been doing all this time!
This isn't what I wanted.
I don't know what that word means.
She blamed him for all her problems.
You need to fix this.
There's a fine line between assertiveness and aggression.
Did you have fun last night?
Do you want to do this now?
This house has six rooms.
Sorry I couldn't come over yesterday. Something came up.
I only need a minute.
Sit down!
You are taller than me.
I meant to have that done by now.
Please turn on the light.
We want to know who's the best.
I haven't got much money.
It's said that nothing is more precious than time.
They'll kill you.
As far as I know, that never happened.
Are you still interested?
I know Tom is boring.
I think that's fantastic.
I like your new hair color.
They are saving their money for the purchase of a house.
Japanese is harder than English.
This tastes moldy.
Avoid it at all cost.
I don't want to waste your time.
I like the color of your car.
You can always text Tom.
I found it necessary to get assistance.
He speaks as if he were an expert.
I'm glad you asked that question.
He's here for me.
When can you start?
He often takes me for a drive.
You don't know Tom as well as you think you do.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
You should stay in the hospital for treatment.
It's a no-brainer.
I doubled over with laughter.
I never use my camera anymore. I just take pictures with my phone.
Tom is sitting on his desk.
I bought shampoo and toothpaste.
We'll all be together.
I thought you of all people would understand my decision.
I'm not now in a position to help you.
I especially want to thank our record-breaking sales team.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
Do you know how his father died?
I advise you to change clothes.
I thought you needed money.
The statistics gave ammunition to her argument.
I think you're jealous.
This is a dangerous mission.
This T-shirt is too small for me.
May I shave your sideburns?
The little girl, deeply moved by the old man's pitiful story, burst into tears.
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
I want to hear you scream.
Mr. Jackson is my favorite teacher.
You were late, weren't you?
He sacrificed everything for you.
She was afraid to travel alone.
I had no other choice but to do it.
I can't see well.
Are you having any trouble breathing?
He did his best never to think of her.
Leave this to me.
Can you repair this?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Do you have any idea what's in the box?
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
I can't get the car to start.
Isn't it your day off?
We're both moving to Boston.
It is clear that he is guilty.
Have you ever read a book in French?
The witness perjured herself on the stand.
Should I start?
I think you deserve more than this.
Most of my traveling companions were nice.
What condition is the building in?
Have you been mistreated?
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
If you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.
I can't find my gloves.
He was guilty of murder.
This theory is scientifically controversial.
Be careful not to fall.
He banged on the table with his fist.
Where do I go then?
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
The two men sitting on the bench were Americans.
I've been here all night.
He told me to leave the window open.
I have to answer his letter.
I think you're a liar.
Was there something you wanted to tell me?
Forget it!
How lucky you are!
If I had wings to fly, I would have gone to save her.
I thought you might be upset.
I don't think your seeing him is good for you.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?
You don't want to know.
A good appetite is a good sauce.
You must be careful.
Stop screaming.
Have you ever been a soldier?
How much is it per box?
I agree with you.
What is she saying?
I go right home after work.
What'll they do to Tom?
Quickly buy all required items.
How many books do you possess?
I've thought a lot about this.
There are a lot of books in the library.
He made her cry.
Which is your target?
We're surprised.
Be seated.
You can sing a song.
It has been raining since yesterday.
I got dumped.
One of you is lying.
Can he speak French?
She was sick in bed yesterday.
There's volcanic ash in the atmosphere.
I don't believe anything you say anymore.
I love watching you cook.
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
Which team are you on?
I was quite lucky.
Tom isn't a boy anymore.
Try some of this.
It's just your imagination.
Tom is like that.
He was chosen captain.
Kids can be so mean.
Are you mentally ill?
It's lunch time.
She takes care of many elderly people.
She can skate.
I can't express myself in English very well.
That's very considerate of you.
I need to get my oboe repaired.
Tom was my best friend.
It's your responsibility to do that.
It's the rule, not the exception.
I can't believe that you kissed Tom.
Don't worry about what others say.
Can we fix this?
The doctor felt my pulse.
I don't find that funny.
What are your qualification?
I do not agree with you at all.
You can go to the station by bus.
I am sure that you will be satisfied.
I don't have a lot of time.
How long has it been since you received a letter from him?
Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher.
What else can you do?
They're going to torture Tom.
It's an old custom.
Don't lean against the wall.
They strolled along the beach.
He continued singing.
Tell me how to do that.
I didn't go to school because I was sick.
He put the luggage down.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
You don't understand the procedure.
I heard it on TV.
I'd like to have a glass of wine.
He had called the rebels traitors.
How many books do you possess?
Go to your room.
She gave him all the money that she had.
Go on.
The ball rolled across the road.
I do want to be your friend.
He had the gall to ignore my advice.
Why don't you give tennis a try?
I feel like a rest.
I had to decide right then and there.
You have my permission.
Am I really that bad?
We've got a room for you.
I can't afford a camera as good as yours.
You cannot live without water.
I'm leaving tonight.
There's a rock in my shoe.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
That's all I can say.
That boy talks as if he were a grown up.
This is a lion.
He solved the difficult problem.
Tom didn't want to sing.
I think we should break up.
I'm not talking to you.
Please keep in touch.
I forgave you a long time ago.
I have to take the test again.
Would you please slow down?
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
This seems risky.
Tom can speak German as well as English.
This is by far the most interesting of all his novels.
I do not like this song.
Tom carried his son on his back.
I hope you're well rested.
Would you like to have a look?
I'd like to take a couple of days off next week.
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
It looks like snow.
You'd better not do it.
I need to find Tom now.
What's in all these boxes?
I spend my free time with my kids.
Tom is always lying.
I lost track of the time.
He is rich, but his older brother is poor.
He came back soon.
You're part of the problem.
Is Tom well?
Is that still my room?
I didn't want to look foolish.
It's not my business.
Why not spend the night?
There it is.
I tried to cheer him up.
I promise you I'll help you.
He got the book down from the shelf.
Something in his face really reminded me of an old boyfriend of mine.
Tom really cares about you.
The warrior is conscious of both his strength and his weakness.
I'll go change.
Don't underestimate yourself.
Good afternoon. You are our new neighbor, if I'm not mistaken?
If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.
He almost died.
The law was changed.
Everything is now ready for you.
I think you need a vacation.
It took me a long time to do my homework last night.
I demand that he be punished.
Would you like to go for a walk?
I believe in fate.
It's a small price to pay.
If you combine them in this way, you get a 14 port USB hub.
We enjoyed skating.
What're you doing?
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
I don't believe that either.
Do you come here often?
I want to do this as much as you do.
You are an idiot to go out in this weather.
Let's clean our room.
I'm hardworking.
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
No one has the right to tell you how to raise your child.
Tom asked us to sit down.
I can't stand kids.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone says he did.
I think you are mistaken.
Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
Did you hear it?
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
He asked me who I was.
We can hear the dog barking.
I've had enough.
I usually stay indoors on Sunday.
I'm the boss.
This is the reason why he did it.
I've been gone for a long time.
We were all disgusted.
Let her sleep.
I'm out of place here.
How does this concern you?
I can't see in because the curtains are closed.
Either is acceptable.
I found the book easy.
His behavior disappointed many of his friends.
The chairs are made of wood.
I want to talk to you alone.
I don't have the energy.
When did you start wearing contacts?
How did you manage to win?
You're not alone anymore.
There isn't any reason to get upset.
I woke up with a headache.
The letter was signed by Tom.
They read newspapers and books.
He told her that she was right.
A fox is a wild animal.
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days.
What do you need me to do?
It is not good to eat between meals.
He did what I wanted right away.
Stir the soup.
Where should I put it?
This job is killing me.
How big you are!
I'm not alone.
Do you really believe I killed my brother?
You're the oldest.
Tom hates to lose.
Be quiet, all of you.
I'll tell you a secret.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
I want you to get your own place.
Are you lonely?
Do we have any chance of winning?
Get me the evidence.
Here comes the bus.
When I was a child, the most painful time of the day was mealtime.
May I be of help in any way?
I will do the shopping for her birthday.
I think Tom wants something to eat.
I felt myself lifted up.
That would be a waste of his talent.
I dislike speaking in public.
You should be very proud of yourself.
I don't like that.
There's something I have to ask you.
What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done?
Tom won't know.
I couldn't get the point of his speech.
Having finished all her housework, she sat down on the sofa to watch television.
Do your best and don't worry.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
Do you think I did it?
It's still not ready.
That mountain is covered with snow.
I wonder who that girl is.
He's an oceanographer.
Her mother is a most beautiful woman.
Pickpockets target tourists.
I didn't catch your last name.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
When did you go to work?
Tom didn't want to sing.
They danced until six in the morning.
Tom wants to go with you.
That's unfair.
I have a bicycle.
This band is really good.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Death before dishonor!
Someone has cut my kite string.
Youth is wasted on the young.
Let me see that list.
You'll call me, won't you?
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
That is a leather belt.
He has lots of new ideas.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
One-fifth of my wages go to taxes.
You really are good.
I have already done my work.
I don't like it when you dance with Tom.
"Why don't you come?" "Because I don't want to."
We had a heavy frost this morning.
You don't have to go.
Who are you supposed to be?
Goat milk is easy for the body to digest.
I feel powerless.
Are you sure they can do this?
In woodworking, we classify wood as hardwood, softwood or exotic wood.
Stand back, please.
He removed his sunglasses.
He can't know the truth.
May I ask you a favor?
You can dance, can't you?
You're about right.
We must do it quickly.
It takes time.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
This may change next year.
Are you homeless?
Coffee keeps me awake.
He went out to eat.
I'm very disappointed in you.
He's a good boy.
Tom is dreaming.
They kept singing until a rescue team came.
I think you'd better come back home.
Your friends are waiting for you.
He reached home shortly before five o'clock.
I used to like folk music.
What a heel!
I wonder what I'll find in the box.
He seldom counts his change.
I like to ride on trains.
I couldn't speak.
We are familiar with that author's name.
I felt my heart beating violently.
Let's wait here.
You're not normal.
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
The fire alarm rang.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
Did you think about our offer?
What do you think happens then?
He said it was out of the question.
Do you think he will like my gift?
That shouldn't be too hard to do.
Tom obeyed.
We'll try even harder the next time.
He carved me a wooden doll.
You said you didn't understand.
You may bring your own lunch to school.
She helped him.
Thanks for the pizza.
Are you joking?
I don't know where it came from.
What part of Australia do you come from?
She divorced him last year.
The statue has no head.
I never found out why.
If it's all right with you, I'd like to stay for a while longer.
I remember the event as vividly as if it were just yesterday.
Take that box away!
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
I value our friendship more than anything.
Please tell me what you heard.
Look on both sides of the shield.
I missed the bus.
Please sit here.
This is just water.
Today is Friday.
Why don't we go somewhere together?
It's too early.
He was busy getting ready for his journey.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
The bus will be here in five minutes.
Maybe your earring is under the table.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
Have you ever been married?
It's all total nonsense.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Tom knew that he'd done something wrong.
All my friends turned their back on me.
We took shelter under a tree.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
I don't know how to handle children.
I'm in bed.
I bet you know French.
I know you're busy, too.
Thank you for this report.
Do you know where she was born?
He left the window open.
I'm going to fly to the moon.
I read about it in the newspaper.
I like the slow rhythm of that song.
This is mine.
Don't you see what's happened?
He admitted that he wanted to escape from here.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I ride a bike to work.
Basset hounds are gentle dogs.
He wore a dark sweater.
He's my husband.
Of us all, Tom was by far the best swimmer.
Tom loves Mary, but she doesn't love him.
You'll get another chance.
He said that he had met her a week before.
I'm seeing someone.
How long have you lived in Japan?
I only need one thing.
Did you have fun?
What did you want to talk with me about?
That's not always the case.
Above all, watch your diet.
There's a church behind my house.
I'll leave this with you.
Children grow very quickly.
I have to change the batteries in the radio.
Please don't die.
I felt like I really belonged there.
He was a general in the Second World War.
It is said that he was very rich.
This is just a paperweight.
That's not what I want.
She was panting.
They'll have a blast.
Stop yelling.
You're free of all responsibility.
I'm tough.
How do you even know that?
How do you plan on paying for that?
I've studied French, remember?
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
She wanted to spare him embarrassment.
We're experienced.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
Washing the car took longer than we expected.
He has a car that I gave him.
It blew my mind.
That woman standing over there is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom sipped some tea.
In general, Japanese are hardworking.
Why are you alone?
You've found it.
Will you pass me the salt?
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
I explained why we had to do it.
She climbed down from the roof.
How many men do you have?
We have a decision to make.
I forgot my briefcase.
It doesn't belong to you.
Why didn't you listen to me?
We're still here.
They just want to have fun.
Tom became anorexic when he was a high school student.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Don't do it!
You fainted.
Cats' eyes are very sensitive to light.
I think your hypothesis is correct.
You'll get another chance.
Tom felt invincible.
I'm a little bit jealous.
Do you know how to program?
Who is your brother?
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
This biography is fascinating.
What do you think of it?
He's reading a novel right now.
Had they known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
Why bother fixing it?
Just look at him.
A great responsibility lies on his shoulders.
He turned off all the lights at eleven.
There is a desk in a corner of the room.
I'm waiting for your assistance.
There's something I feel you should know.
I love astronomy.
I got hot.
You drink too much coffee.
Have you finished reading that book yet?
I was young and stupid.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
She is from France.
Are you going to leave tomorrow?
How unlucky I am!
Why should we harm you?
I think we can do this without any extra help.
Tom never cooks.
Between us, he is a little foolish.
You're here early.
Tom has changed a lot since high school.
After a while, he came to.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
All of us are disappointed.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
Three of the attackers were killed.
I can't give up.
You're lazy.
He came down with a cold.
Have you been told where to park your car?
We can't guarantee that.
Get rid of the gun.
French is one of the languages I've always wanted to learn.
Ain't that cute?
I wish I wasn't such an idiot.
I wish I could live in a house like this.
We're really married.
We don't have the time.
It looks like you want to say something.
She boiled the eggs.
I give you my word.
They are both unmarried.
Where were you born?
I hate myself sometimes.
I didn't get the meaning.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you.
I feel the same way about it as you do.
Do you like it then?
Tom was arrested last year.
No one can tell.
I can seldom find time for reading.
Do you have any idea what happened?
I know Tom has gone.
He was involved in a traffic accident.
He sat beside her on her bed.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
Hello, is this the personnel department?
We're well on our way to making that happen.
I don't like Chinese food at all.
Now I'm done for.
The old man in front of us is ninety-two years old.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
These people are professionals.
It was really just a misunderstanding.
Tom and Mary have decided to eat together.
I thought you hated me.
It's only blood.
Why is the sky blue?
I was outnumbered.
Robert Deniro made a cameo appearance in the movie.
Get me a glass of milk.
Tom hates waiting in line.
I didn't think you'd leave so early.
It's getting late.
Here's a basket full of fruit.
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
I don't want to be chosen.
When I was a child, my mother would often read fairy tales to me.
Tom is already waiting.
They are very interested in astronomy.
Who's the gorgeous girl I saw wandering around in the mall with you?
We see each other once a month.
Does your wife know?
How big you are!
I must go.
Did you take him home?
Tom is a singer-songwriter.
I'll leave it up to you.
They can't all be bad.
I saw the children walk across the street.
The man in charge of the merry-go-round decided to make sure everything was working properly.
Please let me know if it hurts.
He's been staying at that hotel since five days ago.
Speak a little louder.
Do you need a ride?
She has her faults, but I like her.
That's my real name.
No one knows what'll happen in the future.
I am surprised that she refused such a good offer.
Tom folded his shirts.
Tom has a bald spot.
You're not that old.
We must fix this.
None of us knew the answer.
Did you think I wouldn't tell Tom?
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
Don't worry.
Their names have escaped me.
That's just what I needed.
I didn't ask you to come with us.
Tom is convinced that his mother doesn't want to eat now.
Tom jumped out of the window.
There's nothing harder than a diamond.
The sound came from that direction.
Where is the mistake?
I can solve the problem by myself.
We have a pool.
I can handle it myself.
He's been divorced for 2 years already.
In autumn the leaves turn yellow.
How many were wounded?
He is the man you can rely on.
No one cheated.
The ship lowered its gangway after docking.
Are you sure you can do this?
I figured it out by myself.
The boy was absent from school yesterday because he was sick.
That's hardly believable.
She still has a little money, but not much.
He finally made money.
I think Tom is still in love with Mary.
We closed the restaurant.
There is something wrong with my car.
Were you at school at that time?
I didn't mean to challenge your authority.
I got hammered last night.
My idea is different from yours.
Who are you voting for?
He just arrived.
Tom never had that opportunity.
I want you to know all this.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
Her words were like those of an angel.
I miss her so much.
I think she made up that story.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
You make it look easy.
They just left.
Please don't be mad at me.
I acted without thinking.
The flowers smell so good.
I'm much younger than you.
I never wrote to her, despite the urge to do so.
You're being malicious.
Many languages use English words.
You did that.
I want to be an artist.
Tom didn't look very well.
Don't disappear on me again.
You don't seem to love me anymore.
Who's ready to order?
How did you get that nickname?
Tom is a Canadian who lives in Australia.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
He gave up hope.
A priest was called in to give last rites to the dying man.
Do not take any notice of him.
Apart from that, I don't know anything.
I didn't hear what you said.
While you are asleep, the bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls.
Why are you looking at me?
That was wrong, of course.
You were shy.
I am loved by my mother.
She was naive.
Please come again.
I hope you're well rested.
I just don't want any of these.
Have you seen our museums? What do you think about them?
She was my first girlfriend.
The sky is getting brighter.
I wanted to say no.
I will deal with him myself.
The old woman is a doctor.
Who's that?
I'm ill.
That American movie was a great success.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
He sold us out.
She gave him all of her silver.
Have you already decided on your thesis topic?
My wish is to be a singer.
He tried to make his wife happy, but in vain.
He told me not to smoke.
You don't understand what's happening.
She was watching the dead leaves falling.
Do you know how to speak English?
He used a headache as an excuse for leaving early.
Try it once more.
Don't you drag me into this.
This came for you this morning.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
When did you start dating?
That's why I'm here.
Do it again!
I've only had my driver's license for three months.
I can't put up with her any longer.
Just tell me what to do.
That's what you've always wanted.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She was the first one to notice him.
I did it without you.
Look at the evidence.
You can invite any person you like.
After we walked for a while, we got to the lake.
Tom and Mary prayed together.
You're no different.
Did Tom kill himself?
Do you think I could do that?
This word has two meanings.
I could try.
I'm joking, of course.
Do your homework by yourself.
Bring him in.
Madison made an emotional speech in Congress.
Aren't you late?
I'm not asleep.
How can I repay you?
I hope that your brother is better.
She's a very interesting person.
Have you sold it yet?
Stop talking to me about Tom.
How is it that you can speak this language?
Tom began putting on his shoes.
Tom led the discussion.
The prisoner escaped from prison.
Let me help you with that.
He came into the room.
The girl caught a small fish.
There were two cakes.
I want to find a box for this.
Father is still in bed.
Was my letter sent?
He can't read French, much less write it.
I suppose you have the right to know.
I was deeply impressed by Roman architecture.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
I refuse.
I hear you were grounded.
The program starts at nine o'clock.
They are melons.
Tom paid Mary cash.
I can't bear the thought of her with another man.
You're selfish.
It's better than the movie.
What is the time?
Do you sell desk lamps here?
When would it be convenient for you?
It's really awesome.
What do you want to talk to me about?
Who's younger, Tom or Mary?
I told Tom he made a mistake.
He looked over my report.
We had a pleasant evening.
Is this really happening?
I will teach you to program, but not today.
I think you need to leave now.
Have you said anything about this to Tom?
I find that very interesting.
How do we find it?
After several delays, the plane finally left.
I get anything I want.
Tom stared at his feet.
How much money is left?
I really want to know her name.
Prices continued to rise.
Do it again!
Maybe I will buy a brand-new computer.
I really should be going.
Let's grab a quick lunch at that small coffeeshop near the park.
You're creative.
Like I said, no problem.
I didn't invite Tom.
I don't need a lawyer.
I can confirm this.
I'll stay here until ten.
This is your wine.
Tom and Mary became lawyers.
Do Martians speak English?
I wonder why we have ear lobes.
No one disagreed.
I missed the last bus and had to walk home in the rain.
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
I really want to see you.
He managed to escape through a window.
Aren't you in charge?
I love this part.
I enlisted in the Air Force.
It took me three hours to finish my homework.
I regret saying that.
She should be charged with murder.
Just forget it.
That's the only appliance that I have.
We can't do this again.
That's how it was.
I've seen all that.
You won't believe who came by today.
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
Tom promised never to do that again.
There are many kinds of coffee.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
They may leave tomorrow.
This is new.
He's my partner.
It was the best party ever.
She is too young to understand that her father died.
I'll permit you to go.
I need you now.
They mistook my politeness for friendship.
Don't make me leave.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
It was his lengthy narrative that bored me to death.
I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Just who are you?
He's addicted.
I borrowed this comic book from his sister.
We better be going.
She comes to see me from time to time.
I like your scarf.
Does someone here speak French?
I can't even remember my own name.
You are right in a way.
He was humiliated by her.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
I think she's hiding something.
This just isn't like you.
This fact proves her innocence.
She wants him to be her friend.
I just changed my password.
I really shouldn't do this.
How am I supposed to dress?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
Don't climb on this!
Don't make me shoot you again.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
She pleaded with him to stay.
She didn't want him to die.
He went fishing in the river.
Which one of those is yours?
The food was better in prison.
I used to play here as a child.
Don't worry about the past.
I cut myself.
I'll demonstrate.
I just feel awful.
You have to make up the time you have lost.
Tom can speak three languages.
She advised him to take a rest.
If it is raining, I won't go out tonight.
I always obeyed the rules.
Can you recommend a good restaurant for dinner?
I need Tom's address.
Did you listen to music last night?
This is highly unusual.
Have you ever sold a car?
I don't need any help.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
What is for dessert?
You have a really good sense of direction.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
They say that you never get over your first love.
Do you have any tattoos?
Tom bought a house with a magnificent view of the sea.
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
I hope that Tom didn't do that.
Say it clearly.
Someone called.
I'm pleased with their performance.
See you.
You have a lot of work to do.
You don't know where it is, do you?
We are badly in want of water.
I regret having done that.
The pamphlet is free of charge.
He did nothing but cry.
Do I know you?
What's the name of your dog?
She leaves for New York next Sunday.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
We know what the problem is.
Go away. I don't want to see you.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
I don't know much about Australia.
You'll lose everything.
I paid nothing.
It was just hype.
I've been to neither of those places.
Something is going on here.
He was walking ahead of the car.
Eating too much fat is supposed to cause heart disease.
I'd like some sugar, please.
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
I teach French.
I have just arrived. I haven't even unpacked my bags.
You seem pretty calm about it.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
Can you close the door?
It is their right to vote.
That's a bad sign.
Nobody lives in this house.
Glass breaks easily.
I'm dancing.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
Tom wishes he could fly.
The meeting was just about over.
Do you have something to do with this group?
You're worried, aren't you?
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
Give the keys to me.
As soon as it gets dark, the fireworks will start.
I believe Tom will be acquitted.
It's wonderful to be back.
Don't say a word to anyone.
You look incredible.
Maybe he likes you.
Everyone was drinking.
I'm afraid not.
The boy made a paper plane.
Tom wanted to protect Mary.
She didn't telephone after all.
I love that story.
I'd like to pay you back.
While he was lost in thought, he heard his name called.
How do you want to handle it?
Take this medicine after meals.
There's a hole in this sock.
Tom was sitting near a very attractive woman.
I love golf.
I want to please you.
That coffee smells good.
I was only saying my prayers.
Tom is reading the Bible.
I thought this was mine.
I just saw the news.
Maybe we should talk.
I'm pretty sure that it won't snow today.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
Tom gave Mary a box of assorted chocolates.
Do you have a boyfriend?
I can't believe we've never done this before.
I think I can fix this.
Please open the package.
She spent most of her senior year in high school strung out on drugs.
It was really considerate of you to lend me $500 when I was in difficulties.
Tom almost fainted.
You need to do more research.
That girl looks like a boy.
We wouldn't ask you to do that.
Nara is as old as Kyoto.
Be more careful from now on.
It is in the kitchen.
Tom became a successful photographer.
I don't know about you, but I'm starved.
Did Tom break your heart?
I thought we could get together later.
Grief drove her mad.
It's necessary for you to go.
I should've warned you earlier.
You know everything.
I noticed a change.
I read some books.
Tom was my cellmate.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
Is anything missing?
X marks the spot.
Did you try restarting the computer?
Come back here.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
I think we've seen enough.
The maid made my bed.
The train is always on time.
Corn is an important crop in the United States.
When did you quit smoking?
That's just weird.
Our little girl is growing up.
She's still a minor.
I'm tired of listening to your bragging.
I really can't make any promises.
Tom ironed his clothes.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Maybe Tom is stupid.
This is the only one I have.
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
You should go to bed early.
We're not dressed.
Would you like to get something to eat? It's on me.
I do not want to reply to his letter.
Tom will be here any minute now.
The two of us don't belong here.
Wait. I want to show you something.
I have to solve this problem.
Those houses are big.
Thank you for coming to meet me.
The population of Japan is larger than that of New Zealand.
That's an awful idea.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
Would you please show me that skirt?
It was a beautiful wedding ceremony.
He wanted it to be a surprise.
What language is spoken in Egypt?
I must go now.
There's really nothing more we can do.
He dropped to his knees.
I need inspiration.
You'd better go there on foot.
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
Have you heard this story already?
Mother was afraid I would get dirty.
That's my girlfriend you're talking to.
Tom has finally forgiven me.
I want you to know what really happened.
How did you know what I was going to say?
Fortunately, no one was injured.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
I love this part.
Let's jump into the water.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
Tom was killed by a land mine.
I know all I need to know.
Why are we helping Tom?
They think I'm a millionaire.
It's not quite normal.
Tom has quite a quirky personality.
You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true.
We were so tired that we turned in about 9:00 last night.
That's very kind of you to say that.
What is it you want to tell us?
Tom seems young.
As far as I know, he is a reliable person.
Let me answer Tom's question.
I'll never agree to do that.
I feel like an idiot.
The house is opposite the church. You can't miss it.
The conversation moved on to other topics.
My joints ache.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
They huddled together.
It's fun to play tennis.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
The girl lifted the heavy box with one hand.
Maybe Tom will help us find Mary.
Do you get it?
You'll have a rough time.
People should wash themselves.
He is fond of adventure.
Corporations are competing to fill the vacuum.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
I don't need a girlfriend.
We walked in the park.
There's no escape.
I went to Kobe by train.
There's something I have to ask you.
Tom doesn't take criticism well.
I excused myself for a minute.
There's no hurry. We have plenty of time.
This pen doesn't write well.
Careless driving causes accidents.
Spring fever is not a disease.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
You should run for president.
What is your favorite holiday?
Everything changes.
My grandfather goes for walks on days when the weather is good.
Finish your homework before you go to bed.
She has a few friends.
I remember when I first saw you.
That's the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
I'm looking for my watch.
She invited him to her party.
I know what we can do.
I suppose you think I'm nuts.
I must be getting close.
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
Do you want to do it right now?
Whose son are you?
Get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport.
We've installed several security cameras.
Mary had a girls' night out.
I don't enjoy tennis.
This one is all yours.
How much should I feed my dog?
Be polite to everyone.
Some of what Tom said was true.
How did it end?
Don't let them go to waste.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
He made reference to the previous director.
An old woman was burnt to death.
I don't want you to go home.
She doesn't speak to me.
The river flooded the whole region.
They used truth serum.
Come immediately.
Afterwards, he assumed a new identity.
Let's go if it's not raining.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Let me try it.
I immediately stopped laughing.
He has already said yes.
The sky's getting darker.
It's not your fault.
I'm not easily impressed.
When's that supposed to happen?
What a beautiful baby!
Don't make me come back here.
I gave my seat to the old lady.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
I fell into the pool.
I really trust his ability.
There isn't anyone in the room.
Well, let's talk turkey.
This is appalling.
We baked it together.
Do we have time for another cup of coffee?
I must leave early tomorrow.
My cat is hiding under the stove.
Your shoes are here.
What did you just say?
Please close the door quietly.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
What's life like where you live?
He doesn't take vacations.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
The birds are singing.
I surrender.
I have met her before.
Don't delete this file.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
What is the cost of a beer?
Plants don't grow in this soil.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
Is that a trick question?
You're all against me.
He is heroic.
I'm not following you.
It's completely natural.
You should get up early.
I love my mother.
I don't really have a gun.
I used my imagination.
I think you should do this on your own.
They're in the garden.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
She went to the museum by cab.
I want to go.
Change trains at the next station.
Her eyes were filled with tears.
The airbag saved my life.
I just do what I'm told.
The last examination was very difficult.
I think he is angry.
He doesn't sleep.
I will stop you.
I can't count on Tom.
We're not on a date.
What would cause that?
I'm too sleepy to eat.
The old man was run over and immediately taken to hospital.
I don't think Tom wants to see me.
I got a telescope for my birthday.
My throat's a little dry.
I wish you all good luck.
Buildings are much stronger now than they used to be.
You were perfect.
I speak French as well as Tom does.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
My mother spends a lot of money on clothes.
Everything is quiet.
I guess we were happy back then.
You can trust them.
I am very sorry for what I said.
Quit acting like a child.
He writes to me once in a while.
I know this is hard.
You should've gotten up earlier.
We have suppliers.
Do you know what UNESCO stands for?
One minute has sixty seconds.
That man is unworthy of you.
How may I serve you?
Do you want to see my room?
We should do better.
I really want to stay.
I think you panicked.
That's cheap, isn't it?
This is also my first time.
Tom and Mary have gone.
It's completely irrational.
Can you speak French?
Did you volunteer us?
He doesn't live far away.
I still have a lot of work to do.
Who sent you?
I've never seen one like that.
You don't have to answer that.
Tom and Mary were both smiling.
I need to borrow your car.
Lend me your dictionary, please.
Tom denied that he had stolen anything.
Tom slammed down the phone.
Do you understand what the problem is?
I'm more interested in spoken English.
Can I get you anything?
He is the taller of the two.
Are there others like you?
I thought you'd changed.
I can't express myself in French very well.
My mother gets up the earliest every morning.
How do you respond to that?
Do you have any money on you?
With great power comes great responsibility.
I know it's not fair.
Where did you have in mind?
I can see through your lies.
She stayed there for a moment.
The pay is meager.
Please let me see your passport and boarding pass.
Do you know what this is all about?
I suppose that's possible.
I really like this skirt. Can I try it on?
Space travel is dangerous.
Can I have a hug?
Where does that bus go?
We thank you very much!
The cat lay hidden in the bushes.
Can't we keep this between us?
I've locked myself out of my house.
Is it nearby?
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
He never told anyone.
From now on, I'm going to be here for you.
Tom is in better shape than me.
Can I pay for the book by check?
I want you to call the police.
Tom likes to eat ice cream.
I threw a ball to my dog and he caught it in his mouth.
The young woman was carrying an infant in her arms.
Don't make me angry.
The storm prevented me from leaving.
A fuse has blown.
I think I broke my leg.
I'm not the problem.
She fell on her face.
You are in part responsible for it.
Let's go swimming with Tom.
Can I take this with me?
Smoking has affected his health.
We'll eat on the way.
I don't have any friends to talk to.
She went to see him the other day.
Give me another cup of tea.
Get out of my seat.
I was tempted to call in sick.
How did you enjoy the concert?
All the students protested against the war.
The first time is free.
Have you eaten?
He looks healthy.
My mother feels better.
Tom didn't see you.
I'd like to stand.
A strange sound was heard from behind the door.
I heard voices.
What exactly have you got in mind?
Spring is my favorite season.
Trust me.
This isn't surprising at all.
I can't wait to die.
I have some very sad news.
His words are meaningless.
I dipped my finger into the honey.
Tom was a crusader.
I'm a quick learner.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
You don't get enough exercise.
I wish I had a friend like you.
You were in a coma.
She looks a lot like her mother.
Mother went shopping with my brother.
We are short of money.
Tom has black hair.
Tom wants to speak.
Tom graduated in 2013.
Women generally outlive their husbands.
I need some soap.
We had an unpleasant experience there.
Are you finished?
Can you recommend a good play?
I had fun.
He always walks with a rifle.
I caused this.
You're never too old to learn.
What makes you think I'm not happy?
Have you seen Tom lately?
He came to London by way of Siberia.
I have no friend to talk with.
Our house faces the beach.
He often eats fish for dinner.
The boat is sinking.
That's a man's job.
Everybody is equal before the law.
She treated him like a king.
Do come if you can!
I owe a lot of money.
Everybody needs to know this.
I'd rather be hanged than shot.
I'm not happy about it.
We have finished lunch.
Guess what I'm holding in my hand.
What is the main industry in this town?
When did it begin to rain?
You should do all you can to help your neighbours.
Beat the eggs.
How big is your yard?
He laughed nervously.
Ask Tom to do that for you.
What medications are you taking?
Traveling was much more difficult in those days.
Tom started loading the gun.
It just came out.
Is everybody here?
I'll support him.
Eat more vegetables.
I thought about all the times we used to play together as kids.
The hotel was designed by a Japanese architect.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
She did not succeed, but after all that was her first attempt.
Does that suit you?
I was going to go.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
I made plans.
Make love, not war.
Please tell me. I really want to hear it.
That's not something I want to think about right now.
My idea is better.
He is always finding fault with other people.
What's the air temperature today?
Practice is the best teacher.
Give me the book.
I wasn't fast enough.
I think we've wasted enough of our time.
I heard him go out.
I prefer spring to fall.
The paper says that a typhoon is on its way.
Your letter made me happy.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
He is playing golf.
Could you make it a little shorter for me?
The thief used a screwdriver to break into the car.
Are you through with your homework?
I've never seen you like this.
How are you doing these days?
We'll soon learn all we need to know.
You're so predictable.
Are you out of your mind?
People want to own land.
How long do dreams last?
Work is everything to me.
This is what I was waiting for.
He is eager to go there.
I love California.
It's a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
I think you're going to find this interesting.
The problem with many things is the pre-conceived ideas we have about them!
What happened to Tom?
The store was so crowded that they lost sight of each other.
You'll have to discuss that with Tom.
I have to go to sleep.
I saw her play the piano.
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
He gave me a vague answer.
I try to please everyone.
Who crashed the party?
I want to drink some water.
We shouldn't lose courage.
I didn't go.
This is not a tiger.
You've wasted enough of my time.
She's a soccer champion.
Where's this coming from?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Do you like studying?
It being Sunday, the shop was closed.
Can you make it safe?
My father allowed me to go swimming.
All my friends are getting married.
That doesn't give us a lot of time.
The announcer spoke English.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Sit down and shut up.
Teenagers love playing video games.
Electronic components can be cleaned by using pure isopropyl alcohol.
She's worried about your safety.
He gave me some bread, also some milk.
I'm a big fan of golf.
We swam in the sea.
I'll join you later.
You can't handle this alone.
Having a telephone helped her find more clients.
We won.
I forgot your number.
I don't want to listen to you.
We have it all.
I just want to know what to expect.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
Our water pipes burst.
Until you admit that you were wrong, I'm not going to talk to you.
What did you do with that car?
Attendance is mandatory.
Don't worry. We'll find Tom.
Look at me when I talk to you!
Tom, have you eaten yet?
We don't have this in Europe.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There were soldiers on these ships.
Have fun in Boston.
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
He is Italian by birth.
I was happy yesterday.
What is it you have against Tom?
They accused the president of not caring about the common man.
He is pleased with his new shoes.
I read the whole book in one day.
I thought Tom was a doctor.
Tom was acquitted for lack of evidence.
Are you going to buy that dress you were looking at yesterday?
I don't know those people.
It's riskier than it looks.
We came back to camp before dark.
I don't have time to do everything that needs to be done.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
We should observe the speed limit.
Do I have to change my diet?
I know what they're paying you.
I'm learning how to drive.
Tom said that Mary was reliable.
I want to see what happens.
If you touch that wire, you will receive a shock.
I walked alone.
May I see your passport?
Say which one you would like.
Tom thinks he's a genius, but I don't agree with him.
Tom makes his own bed every morning.
Come on, guys. This is not funny anymore.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
I felt as if I had no choice.
He has left already.
They shouted for help.
Even though computer programmers may use semicolons every day, nowadays most people only use semicolons for emoticons.
I saw the movie.
I want to lodge a formal complaint.
Let's split.
Everybody's crying.
She has a cottage by the sea.
I'm not good at pretending.
Is Tom absent today?
He often eats fish for dinner.
My eyes are blue.
She bought a dozen eggs.
They're out of their minds.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
Get some help, will you?
You're young and strong.
I can't let them do this to me.
Do you have psychic powers?
You may be right.
I had an amazing experience.
I'm in bed.
I don't know who else to turn to for help.
What if someone sees it?
I bought him a tie.
It was a miracle.
If you're not happy, quit.
Who are you going with?
Tom and Mary are still young.
We'll have loads of fun.
He's now on the boat.
You should have a doctor look at that.
What do you have to say about that?
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
Don't forget what I just told you.
I'd like to dance with you.
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
He is not what he was ten years ago.
Tom said that's just not true.
The tenor sang very well tonight.
He arrived as soon as he could.
I think he's too young.
I asked myself that same question.
Sometimes I have the impression that we'll never come to an agreement.
You should quit gambling.
You're so impatient.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I don't know why I did that.
My brother is three years younger than me.
If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip.
They don't care.
A guy nearly ran into us.
A soldier often has to confront danger.
I'll leave that up to you.
She didn't pay back the money.
The person responsible has been fired.
I don't have any money.
I can't believe that Tom wouldn't do that for me.
I'm not good enough for you.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Who forced you to do that?
I'm on the way home.
Tom wanted to become a farmer.
Wash your hands well.
I know you're thinking about me.
Did you get the check?
Tom is a really good friend.
I want to see Tom tomorrow.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
He was frozen to death.
Where's the bathroom?
If I had enough money, I'd buy this.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.
I took care of it for you.
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
What's it called?
She's a tough one.
Tell me what I did wrong.
I got there ahead of time.
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
He came to Berlin as a teacher.
A good doctor is sympathetic to his patients.
They can't hurt you now.
I love watching movies that make me think.
I study mathematics.
We're up against the wall.
I know you're not comfortable.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Who told you all that?
What are you doing buying a house that expensive?
She was obliged to marry the old man.
This is your house.
I want to make you happy.
Please sing.
The pier took a real beating from the hurricane.
It's already late.
He did better than last time.
You seem distracted today.
It's a good thing.
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
I want them to be your friends.
I wanted to be a journalist.
I didn't want the baby to catch a cold, so I closed the window.
We rested for a while.
I don't know her address.
Could you spare me a little time?
Why don't we all sit down?
I'm still single.
I'm still your friend.
What is still better is that the house has a beautiful garden.
He warned me that I would fail.
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
Tom couldn't sleep last night.
The dog is panting.
I'm old enough to drink.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
I made tea.
I remember that I gave him the key.
I have a request to make.
Didn't you read the book?
She always boasts of her luck.
He's a slob.
That was the best meal I've ever eaten.
I am terribly hungry.
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I would rather die than surrender.
Was anyone in the room?
My ideas are different from yours.
Why not just quit?
That's very sweet of you.
I just want to put it all behind us.
Tell me that was a joke!
Shouldn't we ask Tom?
I hate to be a nuisance.
I don't like chocolate.
My dog goes everywhere with me.
Tom pulled out a pencil.
You're all mine.
Why are people scared of Tom?
Tom doesn't like it when Mary criticizes him in public.
I am not eating.
Just ignore him.
Is it your bike?
He'll wait for us to call him.
Somehow I thought you'd say that.
I have a mission to complete.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Where will you be?
They made fun of my clothes.
It was a warm summer evening.
That's not how I want things to be.
I know my father will help me.
Her name wasn't on the list.
Did you have fun tonight?
What is the most beautiful thing in the world?
That's the problem with doing things your way.
Mary really is a very cute girl.
Did you volunteer us?
You were scared, weren't you?
The students burned their textbooks.
He was surprised by what he learned.
What is your address?
What time do you usually get up?
I feel like I'm going mad.
I'm used to being laughed at.
I'm smarter than you.
You're contradicting yourself.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I'd prefer not to eat that.
If you came, that would be great.
She did not answer all the questions.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
Is that all clear?
"May I use your telephone?" "By all means."
I have a date tomorrow night.
I wish you had come with us.
Sure, it might be traumatic, but so what?
I couldn't remember ever having met her.
You can't change Tom.
I'm no friend of yours.
I wanted to wish you well.
Tom is waiting for us, isn't he?
He is poor.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
I could've helped you out.
His curiosity knew no bounds.
She tried on the party dress.
Don't look so shocked.
Do you feel at home anywhere?
What did you expect?
France was at war with Russia.
Is that what you want me to say?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit.
You're too old for me.
How could Tom have done that?
It was nothing less than a miracle.
Why aren't you doing your homework?
I must repay the debt.
I own a yacht.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
It's impossible to change it now.
That's barbaric!
I had a terrible stomachache.
I hate this kind of place.
Tom should've told us about this.
I knew Tom wasn't going to win.
The weather will delay the start of the race.
I'm one of the thirty people who want to do that.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Tom lost his wallet.
I was probably wrong.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
She claimed to be the owner of the land.
I need Tom's help.
That's an order.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Have you gone over the lesson?
I guess it's OK.
We've looked everywhere, haven't we?
We're here now.
He did all the legwork.
That's not what worries me.
Stop jumping on the bed.
That would be fine.
What's Tom afraid of?
You're loaded.
This box is full of apples.
You seem a little tense.
How far are you prepared to go?
I've seen too much.
There is no choice.
Have you ever taken a lie detector test?
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
You're not in a hurry, are you?
May I smoke here?
It was an immediate success.
I thought we were best friends.
It's a strange one.
I heard that there were alligators in the sewers.
A new oil tanker was launched.
By the way, how old are you?
My watch is more accurate than yours.
It couldn't have been better.
No one knows where we are.
How was your trip to Australia?
I'm going to be a father.
Look at the picture.
Is that real blood?
The server is down.
He can't come with us.
He was fully clothed.
He thinks that blue is the most beautiful color.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
Tom opened his beer and took a sip.
I would like you to sing a song.
Did you receive the letter?
My life is almost over.
Do you like French opera?
My feet are sore.
I'm well aware of the risks.
This has nothing to do with that.
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
I never planned on coming back here.
Try as hard as you can.
I'll get in touch with you next week.
I'm afraid I can't save you this time.
All of us looked through the window.
I am more beautiful than you.
The path zigzagged up the steep slope.
You should've done that.
Don't call me.
What are you doing?
Stop right here.
I didn't tell anyone.
I guarantee it.
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
The urban population in most developing countries is increasing very fast.
You are the kind of guitarist I like to sing with.
Do you want to go tell Tom about this?
You can't believe anybody.
She laughed so hard she cried.
I wonder if I should talk to her about the problem.
Why don't we talk in your office?
There's nothing more I can tell you.
Mary's parents hate Tom.
I don't know where they are.
Tom only knows how to speak French.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
What if you were able to buy the house you've always dreamed of?
Tom made three errors.
This is the most comfortable chair I've sat on in a long time.
All you can do is trust one another.
You should not break your promise.
He was playing the piano.
If he's fluent in English, I'll hire him.
We can't go there.
Tom was silent for a moment.
Don't expect any mercy from me.
Can you do it faster?
I want you to come back early.
I have a comment.
I don't know where I am exactly.
I think your French has improved a lot.
You should have seen the movie.
I'm in the mood for something sweet.
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
We were supposed to protect Tom.
I want you all out of here.
Mary knitted Tom a sweater for his birthday.
Could you check this for me?
Have they spotted you?
It was harder than I thought.
Thank you ever so much.
They charge too much for parking.
Tom reads to his daughter.
Tom despised Mary.
You don't have to get up early.
I want to drink tea.
I really can't accept this.
Tom has beautiful blue eyes.
We're all bored.
What did it look like?
Neither one of them disagrees.
Everything has a price.
He is one of my neighbors.
I would like to read some books about Lincoln.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
You can't do anything right, can you?
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
I think you should tell Tom you love him.
Here is a present for you in token of our appreciation.
I often think of my dead mother.
Can you slow down a little?
Tom is doing everything he can to save money.
Stop singing that song.
I can't carry on like this.
Tom seems to be a kind person.
He was staring at her.
Tom paid Mary cash.
As a matter of fact, I do speak French.
Apparently my bare feet bothered him more than anything else.
You're arrogant.
I think we may have a problem.
A walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Suddenly, the dog started barking.
When she heard the news, she broke down crying.
Tom has come to see you.
It's not up for discussion.
Did you win the race?
Do you know how long they have been married?
I made a fool of myself.
Do a better job next time.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Pay attention to the road.
I asked him about the accident.
Tom said he'd like to visit Boston.
Nobody can stop us from doing that.
This is the largest dictionary there is in this library.
Despite everything, Tom started to relax.
He thought that it would be interesting and fun.
They can't hurt you.
Country life is very peaceful in comparison with city life.
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar.
This is someone I want you to meet.
Did I mention that before?
I don't think that you should worry about it too much.
It is a pity that he has no sense of humor.
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
Doing that will take a long time.
I'll never leave you alone again.
He pressed his ear against the wall.
He picked up a hat and put it on to see how it would look.
I don't like your taste in colors.
You should not keep people waiting.
I like this season.
I'd like to believe you.
He had no choice but to run away.
After that, he went home.
He didn't protest.
How are your grades?
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I'm waiting for a very important call.
It is said that smoking is bad for your health.
I never learned his real name.
She's a sweet girl.
She told him that she believed in astrology.
They all have kids.
What did you do to it?
How do you intend to do it?
All the guys teased me about it.
That is your book.
The new model will be priced at $12,000.
My wife isn't beautiful. Yours is.
It belongs to Tom.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
I know Tom was hesitant to do that.
I argued with him about it.
Tom loves Mary.
I love to take pictures.
Did I wake you?
It's not a computer problem.
Tom wished Mary good luck.
Do you speak French?
I had to see it for myself.
She sorted the washing before putting it in the washing machine.
There is a nice park in the center of the town.
I didn't think it would matter.
We'd better leave him alone.
What's the real reason you're here?
This knot will not hold.
I don't expect you to understand this.
You need not go there.
Did you tell anybody?
It's useless to try.
It was an excellent game.
I'll have to confiscate your knife.
My father's car is very nice.
I know Tom is troubled.
I have a lot of problems to solve.
He never fails to write to his mother every week.
Excuse me for one moment.
He made it known to his friends that he was unwilling to run for the election.
He sat there surrounded by his children.
I hope your brother is better.
I want to know why you weren't at the meeting this morning.
He seems to be involved in that matter.
Let's forget about what happened last night.
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
I'd love to do it.
I never thought Tom would hit Mary.
We're here to help them.
What train you are going to take?
I know Tom is chubby.
Let's decide together where to go first.
I figured I could count on you.
I don't know what to say about that.
I'd like to join you.
Tom certainly doesn't speak for all of us.
Please call the fire department.
I usually don't make mistakes.
I have a hangover.
I used to play here.
Why don't you trust me?
I was a little afraid.
What brings you here?
I have a ten-year-old boy.
You have a pretty good memory.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
We're losing.
Prices are lower in Boston.
Are you seeing anyone?
You did it in front of the staff.
Do you mind if I go?
I know the poem by heart.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
I'm glad to hear Tom wasn't injured.
The car doesn't start.
We want to reach a wider audience.
She must have worked very hard.
Would you mind if I left early?
My robot's name is Multi.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
Do you think I can use my cellphone in the shower?
Look at her putting on airs over there.
May I bother you for a moment?
She loves shopping.
I figured that you wouldn't come.
Today it's very sunny, so everyone is wearing sunglasses.
Do you have time?
The ice was thick enough for me to walk on.
I'll do anything.
I don't remember anything.
Do you want to drink?
I hardly got any sleep last night.
You can't get rid of me.
The music carried me back to my childhood.
That's very kind.
I thought I heard music.
The situation there was critical.
I will never do it again.
Please replace the empty ink jet cartridge in the printer.
I like bread.
I think you'll be able to do it.
Where can I reach you?
That proposal may be a way to kill two birds with one stone, but we also have to be careful not to get greedy and spoil everything.
You must stick to your diet.
Were you born there?
Your life is in danger.
He made a small dog house.
Who were you protecting?
Get out while you can.
Everyone was hungry.
I went to the shop.
He's a stand-up guy.
I know that's not true.
I've never read a novel in French.
Are you students?
I woke you up.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
I'm not a millionaire.
How do you want me to handle that?
There's no shortage of work around here.
I've got it all.
That is how the accident occurred.
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
If I were you, I would follow his advice.
If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
He looked satisfied with my explanation.
That is the same umbrella that I found on the bus.
Tom likes snow.
What're you doing today?
I think you ought to rest a while.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
I don't know what has become of the boy.
What are your duties?
I just want to know how far we're going.
The warnings were ignored.
I know only this.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
We'll start whenever you are ready.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
It's a quarter to three.
I am going to introduce you to the rest of the crew.
It may well be true.
I want you to dance with me.
Tom doesn't like to travel.
Come to my house this afternoon.
Come home before it gets dark.
No one laughed.
He's been trying to contact you for weeks.
She stays in touch with him.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
I can't believe we're going to lose.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
What did the doctor say?
This movie is a masterpiece.
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
Are you eating lunch?
I love that place.
I don't know what I did wrong.
Have you looked in the bottom drawer?
Do you have any plans later on?
You know people.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Tom accepted our invitation.
Speaking Japanese is easy for me.
You should stay.
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Is she coming, too?
I've got a big day tomorrow.
I am terribly afraid of snakes.
Tom wants to know what's going to happen next.
The situation is desperate.
We have witnesses.
I think you know what you should do.
It's your problem, not mine.
I stayed.
We have arrived safe and sound.
You should eat more fruit.
Nobody died.
Can you promise me you won't do that?
He went out to eat.
I like reading American novels.
Whose friend are you?
I seldom see him.
"Do you have anything to do?" "Nothing in particular."
Don't do anything stupid.
He is a doctor.
I'm trying my best.
Please refrain from pushing forward.
Who taught you how to use chopsticks?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
There are wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot perceive.
I want to share my thoughts with you.
Neither one is acceptable.
As had been expected, the weather turned out to be very fine.
They were taken prisoner.
This just happened to me.
I can't do it right away.
I have the feeling there's something you haven't told me yet.
I'm counting on you.
I'd like you to be my partner.
I watched a Swedish movie last night.
Why did you keep that a secret?
He has no choice.
Do I annoy you?
The CIA runs a thorough background check on all new employees.
Tom spoke in French.
I sleep with two quilts in the winter.
Are you doing all right?
Does he have a girlfriend?
All sorts of people came to the exhibition.
We're not supposed to do that.
My husband and I are both teachers.
I'm not a native speaker.
There are a few boats on the lake.
We're glad you're here.
You have to go.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
After she had lunch, she got ready to go out.
I did not order this.
I want him to solve the problem.
I went on a ten-day trip to Easter Island.
It was his car, not mine, that broke down yesterday.
I thought Tom said it was a dog.
Don't worry. I'll do it.
Are you close to your parents?
I am sure that he will succeed.
I like coffee much more than tea.
I could read between the lines.
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
He's afraid that he might be late.
They are very big.
You must go outside if you want to smoke.
I don't like this type of house.
I'm sometimes careless.
It makes no sense.
Can you crank up the heat?
A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody.
I've only just come back.
Do you know how many there are?
I was only teasing.
That's a good picture of you.
He was slain in battle.
Who painted this painting?
You're starting to scare me.
Tom called Mary at about 2:30.
It's unlikely Tom will win.
Do you think I should go alone?
What does this remind you of?
I will keep on smoking no matter what you say.
Tom's death was an accident.
Don't you do this to me.
Can't you hear the sound?
You have made the very same mistake again.
Is there any likelihood of his coming?
I want to learn to sing like you.
The damage is done.
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
How about playing tennis next Saturday?
Tom eats rice almost every day.
There are similarities.
Tom came yesterday.
I like coffee and toast for breakfast.
Everyone hoped that she would win.
He was punished for lying.
There were many things that we needed to do to prepare for our trip.
I have a schedule to keep.
I want you to get some rest.
I didn't catch what he said.
He was very nervous.
She will be happy when she gets married.
One of the best ways to help us is to translate from a foreign language you know into your own native language or strongest language.
How did you come up with such a good idea?
I'm just being honest.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
I haven't seen him for years.
It's a fad.
Have a safe trip.
I'd like to get you both to help me.
As soon as I've finished doing that, I'll help you.
I was on a trip to India.
Didn't you hear me?
Something wasn't right.
I called earlier.
I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
You must be more careful from now on.
It was a tragedy.
Whose bicycle is that?
She is good at making up interesting stories.
Newspapers carry weather reports.
Have you asked if they want one?
Tell Tom I'm not home.
She looks better in Japanese clothes.
I'll be checking on you.
My sister resembles my mother.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Tom knows it was a mistake.
It's an ambitious plan.
Because some urgent business came up, he wasn't able to go to the concert.
It was pretty incredible.
I'm not in love with anyone.
She sleeps on her stomach.
When she heard the bad news, she fainted.
I can handle it.
Are you watching carefully?
Tom stopped me from leaving the classroom.
Tom has a meeting this morning.
A lot of soldiers died here.
I never thought I'd finish it.
I want to tell you about my problems.
Your sister cannot swim well, can she?
Can you give him first aid?
I knew you'd be mad.
My school marks were average.
Please refrain from smoking here.
You cannot take pictures in the theater without permission.
I'm proud of you guys.
He was too short to get at the grapes.
My internet connection is slow.
If you rest, you will be back on your feet again soon.
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
They're not alone.
Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't see the whole staircase.
Can you excuse me a second?
I don't want to live like that.
Do you mind if I open the window and let the smoke out?
I wish I could figure out how to make more money.
We have a few surprises in store for her.
Are you a policeman?
I'm not happy.
This is not enough.
Have I caught you at a bad time?
You have everything.
I don't know how long it'll take.
This really isn't that simple.
I'll soon register for a course in German.
No one gave up hope.
She has a picture.
Eggs are sold by the dozen.
How did you get to know about her?
His accent suggests he is a foreigner.
They're lucky to be alive.
I have a permit for this gun.
He was aware of being watched.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
I've always wanted to meet you.
It was lots of money.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
As soon as I left home, it began to rain.
Tom made a list of what he needed.
Did you do this all yourself?
Can you stay for a while?
Don't just take my word for it.
Have you read this article?
He should have come.
I was terribly confused by his question.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
All human beings are mortal.
That's not what I understand.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
I more often go to Brussels than Paris.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it.
I feel ready.
People have short memories.
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
They smell bad.
Are you afraid of the dark?
I was convicted.
Are you real sure about that?
I thought you were kidding.
Where do I pay for the gas?
He gave the same answer as before.
The scarecrow in the backyard fell over during the hurricane.
This is my favorite movie.
I don't feel well today.
Why do you like Tom so much?
Do you use aftershave?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
You must run.
You won't feel a thing.
It's never happened to me.
I want you to come and get me.
You've got my sunglasses and I want them back.
We'll never forget your kindness.
Do you really want to eat that?
He had a loving family.
The local newspaper is endorsing the conservative candidate.
We have breakfast at seven.
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
The mayor denied having taken a bribe.
You can tear the box open.
What was your relationship with your father like when you were a kid?
I suppose I'd better leave.
Everyone did a fabulous job.
Is Tom studying French?
All of a sudden, it became cloudy.
I like my life the way it is now.
She touched him on the shoulder.
What did your wife say?
The baby cannot use a spoon yet.
This lake is deepest at this point.
Don't ever lie to me again.
Science is cool.
What does the future hold?
This one is bigger.
Do you believe in the power of love?
Meat is very expensive nowadays.
She has no self-esteem.
I was not conscious of a man looking at me.
I hear what you're saying.
Your wife left.
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?
What I say is true.
I'm downstairs.
I won't be able to attend the conference.
She doesn't understand me, either.
I don't know how much money we've got.
I want to buy ski boots.
Tom didn't have shoes on.
It's going to be difficult to do that.
I telephoned her at once.
Is it free?
It was truly depressing.
They are the ones who want to go.
You've already forgotten.
I ran out of the house.
He's wet.
Every time they talk, they argue.
Scott was a contemporary of Byron.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
I want to know where you heard that.
Remain seated, please.
Does your dog bite?
Tom didn't tell Mary everything.
You don't seem tired at all.
He believes that the story is true.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
I'm really disappointed in you, Tom.
We met them at the youth hostel.
How did you know I was going to say yes?
Has anything changed?
Who else was there?
What were you expecting?
This car needs washing.
The archer killed the deer.
It wasn't difficult to do that.
I need a little more time.
Thank you very much for all you have done.
I called you.
You've got the map upside down.
I'm a bank clerk.
I don't want to embarrass you.
It's what you deserve.
We're escaping.
Do you want to play a game?
Never talk to strangers.
I hate long flights.
The enemy is becoming more and more powerful.
Tom was offended by what Mary said.
Do you see the raccoon?
Books are to the mind what food is to the body.
Lying to Tom was a mistake.
Don't worry. You can count on me.
Tom sat alone with a half-empty bottle of wine.
How's everything going?
What more do you want?
There is little, if any, hope of his being alive.
Go at once, otherwise you will be late.
Health is better than wealth.
Are they selling their house?
He spoke highly of you.
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
I hate reptiles.
I ate the salad.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Did you sleep all day?
Day in and day out, he does nothing but tend his sheep.
I can't wait to meet him.
We need sleep.
Two sheep were killed by a wolf.
I gather you were unsuccessful.
I regret that decision.
The doctor says she suffers from rheumatism.
Tom had a difficult job.
Stay out of my way!
I'm surprised it was that easy.
Have you ever wanted something so much that you'd do anything to get it?
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
It's so nice to stay at home.
What do you want to drink?
That's so immature.
Nothing succeeds like success.
Let me take your temperature.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
Don't drag me into this.
Tom showed me his photo album.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this on eBay?
Fish, please.
We must not break our promise.
That's what I got.
He is a member in good standing.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
How big you are!
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
I heard that you became the manager of the Sydney branch.
It's the ultimate test.
You can't believe a word he says.
You're worse than Tom.
I thought your dad took away your credit card.
I like these hats.
I made a decision.
I'd like to sing a song.
How do you think you're doing?
What time did you wake up?
The doctor instructed me to go on a diet.
You're the owners.
They're mad at you.
It's awfully cold this evening.
Tom always makes fun of John because of his dialect.
Why did he stop smoking?
I think you're lying.
Where is your dog?
I always have trouble remembering names.
I thought that you were able to speak French.
I've got to see you.
We don't need you.
All I want is for you to be happy.
Tom says he's planning to buy Mary a gift.
The wine was excellent.
I have heartburn.
I have no idea who that is either.
He caught a big one.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
There's no proof.
We all suffered.
I realized what was happening.
He's ahead in the race.
What natural foods help curb the appetite?
He is madly in love with that girl.
Where did you hide it?
Is that significant?
It's a very good question.
Turn on the TV.
He cried and cried.
Please don't tell anyone else.
Tom didn't get Mary's phone number.
You don't have to yell at me.
Please don't be sad any more.
I am always ready to help you.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
It could be a coincidence.
They're spies.
I didn't say that.
I am sure we have a lot in common.
She hit him.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Tom left his wife and children.
When will you be back?
I felt cheated.
Who were they talking about?
We'll always be friends.
They can't believe it.
Can I see you a second?
I don't understand what's happening.
Tom is someone I really enjoy hanging out with.
About how many hours does it take by car?
Aren't you going to take your coat off?
It was colder yesterday than today.
I was getting worried.
Can you help me clean this up?
He is the last man I want to see.
The roast lamb is very good.
You're sure about this, right?
I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
I can't understand this word.
I don't regret what happened last night.
Would you like to come to my party?
You would make a good diplomat.
Are you picking on me?
Why are you sleeping?
Are you hiring?
I just want to be prepared.
Let me stop you right there. We don't want to hear about that.
Tom is getting ready to go.
I saw Tom naked.
They had a heated discussion.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
I'm only going to show you once.
Tom knew that Mary loved him.
They all entered.
Don't mind me. Just keep doing what you were doing.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
We'll look into the case at once.
Do you know who those people are?
The bird is dead.
You're very good.
Almost no one believed her.
We aren't afraid of death.
Tom is a Boston native.
Why didn't she come?
Why don't you take off?
You three are very lucky.
Many countries depend on agriculture.
I don't need to talk to him.
I'd like to have the sauce on the side, please.
Go and help your brother.
They don't know us.
The actress tore up her contract angrily.
I shouldn't complain.
Have you told me everything?
I should be happy.
How do I apply for a visa?
Aren't you dressed yet?
He carries a bag on his back.
I don't think anyone really knows the real me.
Tom decided to cooperate.
Let's be clear.
She's not a bad girl.
They say that in America anyone can become president, but perhaps that's not really true.
I guess you know I've missed you.
Last night my house was robbed while I was still awake.
My mother is an early riser.
The arrow indicates the way to go.
I hate my life.
I interpreted her silence as a refusal.
My children rarely go outside.
He was a trusted friend.
Isn't that what you were hoping for?
Since he was feeling sick, he stayed home from school.
He lives in Nagasaki.
She advised him to visit that museum.
He wants you to come home.
The baby was naked.
This won't be easy.
I locked myself in my room.
Do we know each other?
Some newspapers distorted the news.
I can't dance.
They will help you to get warm.
I'm frantic.
You could have drowned.
It's still not working.
The ship set sail for Bombay.
I prefer being poor to being rich.
None of us are against his idea.
This job involves lots of hard work.
Why is that baby crying?
May I take a shower?
They won't last that long.
Everything is subject to the laws of nature.
Would it be ethical to sacrifice one person to save many?
It is doubtful whether he will come or not.
He's very sloppy in his dress.
I can wait for you.
Now let's begin the game.
Everybody panicked.
Don't go against his wishes.
The day is almost over.
Horses are animals.
You probably wouldn't understand this.
Philosophers tend to have little contact with the outside world.
Do you want to play a game?
I want Tom to lose.
What do you think happens then?
She ignored him until he became rich.
Are you vegetarian?
He found the door locked.
Would you mind telling me one thing?
I'm sure you have other skills.
The police are after you.
The police assembled a lot of evidence against him.
The bus stopped, but no one got out.
Supplies of oil are not infinite.
Why would I want to help Tom?
We have a lot of good restaurants here in Boston.
I slept very well last night.
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you.
It's about 8 kilometers away.
I'd like a receipt, please.
In case it rains, I won't go.
I don't like any of these paintings.
You didn't need to come.
We've done it all.
Did you read all of it?
Say which one you would like.
She is bad at sports.
Tom will never make it.
I'm still shopping around.
Solar energy is a new source of energy.
Tom will be happy to see you again.
Say it in French.
I don't know what to answer.
It would have been nice if you had helped me a little.
Sentences begin with a capital letter.
Do you disagree?
I don't believe it was an accident.
We talk frequently.
Tom likes that one.
Let's put off the meeting until next Friday.
This is an important night.
What mileage do you get with this car?
What do I need to know?
I would like a word with you.
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
Rice grows in warm climates.
I have been to the station to see him off.
You've been infected.
Words failed me.
They've just left.
I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
I read it in a magazine.
How do you usually spend your weekends?
You must not forget your schoolbooks.
I've made up my mind to learn how to play the harp.
It's a very small price for such an important victory.
She's a real gossip.
How soon can you have this dress ready?
Their losses reached one million yen.
You can go to the station by bus.
Help me if you can.
Have you called her yet?
Tom was obviously angry.
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
The house is warm.
Everyone is outraged.
I can't trust anybody.
I'm back in business.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
He smiled and said goodbye.
Are you going to ask Mary to go to the prom with you?
Tom doesn't trust us.
He left the room without saying a word.
Nothing is new under the sun.
I hope you had a nice trip.
Bring it back when you're done.
The sky was gray.
I want the facts.
I don't have to apologize for what I said.
You'll soon be able to sing as well as Tom.
I'm resilient.
I have to live on my very small income.
I'm a mature adult.
May I see you tomorrow?
I'd like to stay and chat, but I've got a meeting to go to.
He loves soccer.
That's all I have to say.
It is two o'clock in the morning.
How well can you dance?
Let me check.
I must give Tom that.
I'm not ashamed.
It is of great value.
I want Tom to hear your story.
Are your parents home?
Tom is waiting for you in his office.
They grew closer.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
He collected bits of information.
As strange as it may sound, what Tom said is true.
I can't believe you just did that.
Is anything happening?
I'm not going.
I didn't see your car outside.
Do you want to go?
He had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.
They said yes.
I don't understand what he said.
I haven't yet done what you've asked me to do.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
He is alert to every chance of making money.
Whoever wants it may take it.
I left my guitar in your office.
We need rules.
Do you come here often?
What is the most romantic city in the world?
Was that a squirrel?
Why's Tom still here?
It was too expensive.
It's still raining.
The room was in perfect order.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I used to do that as a kid.
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
This land is your land.
I don't feel like going out.
She died yesterday.
Someone broke into my house last weekend.
She was absorbed in her work.
I like your painting.
Ask me anything!
Why do Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving?
Get your gear.
We arrived here in the evening.
Tom's broken arm took several weeks to heal.
I really ought to go.
Who told you the news?
I can't find Tom.
That's what I want most.
Neither of them looks busy.
Do you really want to put your money in that bank?
Have you finished reading the book?
We must cut our expenses to save money.
I want to say goodbye.
Which one will he choose?
Don't leave your work half finished.
The birth rate and death rate were nearly equal.
Tom's dog hates cats.
One of them is a spy.
I'll bring it back.
That's an interesting idea.
I'm going to be late for the meeting.
This one is a lot easier.
This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous.
Would you like it washed?
Where's the nearest bathroom?
I disagree with you on this.
I know the real reason for his absence.
I managed to acquire the book after a long search.
I'm not here for you.
The files are missing.
I don't agree with segregation of people by race.
You speak fluent English.
It goes without saying that it was supremely difficult to carry out this mission.
I'm giving my old books away.
He saw the accident on the way to school.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
Show me.
Birds fly south in the winter.
How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
I hope that you feel better tomorrow.
Tom is too old for me.
I met some hikers on the mountain.
Please come and help me.
Everyone's saying it.
I wish she had come last night.
I know a few words of French, just enough to be understood.
I don't want you to leave.
Is the room big enough for you?
I want to meet with Tom.
You should have seen it.
I want a refund.
Who made the actual arrest?
Do you know where the supermarket is?
I stopped laughing.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
I paid 300 dollars for this guitar.
I'll mail this letter today.
Shouldn't you call the police?
We saw you.
Who were you talking with?
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
I was off duty at the time.
I wish he were here now.
You need to find your own way.
Tom and Mary were great neighbors.
Don't miss the bus.
Well, stranger things have happened.
You've been selected.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
He's a bartender.
It seems that you're not having fun in here.
What exactly did you do?
Pull the plant up by the roots.
I know now what we have to do.
How can you say such a foolish thing?
We have people who do that for us.
You have a great imagination.
Tom hoped to get back together with Mary.
I've tried to warn you.
That's the problem.
I am tired.
I can't do this without you guys.
Let's eat before we go.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
The street was very empty.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
We can all walk home.
You are such a sweetheart.
You look incredible.
You go first.
The answer is pretty simple.
Let's have a contest. The side to come up with the worst insult wins.
Have you looked at these brochures?
I'm glad you're OK again.
It's time to go back home.
He won't come, will he?
Tom isn't the only one who's exhausted.
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
In a few days, the baby will be able to walk.
I've already told Tom that.
My favorite sport is skiing.
I knew there was something fishy about that guy.
A true gentleman never betrays his friends.
She betrayed you.
I'm always happy.
Tom is much better at French than me.
Is your name on the list?
We don't trust Tom.
Call if you need anything.
How long may I borrow this notebook?
I didn't even know Tom had a girlfriend.
My dog eats just about anything.
There is an urgent need for medical supplies.
So where were you?
She practices the piano in the afternoon or in the evening.
I feel like I'm ready.
I'm taking a vacation.
That's a bright idea.
I have a slight fever today.
May I request a favour of you?
The accident happened two hours ago.
Please settle this account by October 28, 1998.
I don't get what you mean.
We have two daughters.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
I ate some potato chips.
The red skirt is new.
Tom said it was his fault.
Do I really have to drink that?
Are you here voluntarily?
I want to remember all of this.
He's the one who touched me.
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
I wonder how many horses died during the Civil War.
I wanted to make you feel at home.
Get out if you can.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
I didn't catch your last name.
I have to get up quite early tomorrow.
I'm slightly hungry.
Plastics have taken the place of many conventional materials.
The water's really nice.
This sentence has five words.
Was it difficult to make?
I'll fix it now.
I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
Are you sure you're not taking on too much?
We need to get out of here.
Are we prepared?
There's no hurry.
Tom didn't arrive until it was already too late.
Now that you know the truth, perhaps you'll feel better.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I learned from the best.
I outrank you.
Are you finished reading the paper?
Is anything the matter?
I appreciate the help.
She began to sing.
You should put on some clothes.
It's such a beautiful flower.
Don't kill me.
Who knows what's going to happen?
Where were you born?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
You're not helping.
Tom knows a lot of songs.
Is this fake?
They swam.
Don't walk out on me again.
I would've done it.
We had nice weather yesterday.
I liked your friends.
She can speak not only English but also French.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
I have a letter written by him.
I'd like to see your sister.
Spouses are also welcome.
I wanted you to keep that.
I thought I'd surprise you.
The radio is too loud. Turn the volume down.
That's just false.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
Where's the train station?
What are you up to?
They all laughed at their error.
The floor was covered with dust.
He nearly got away with it.
Potentially, that could happen again.
Who invented the telephone?
That's not what I heard.
The night's still young.
It was extremely funny.
The earth moves around the sun.
At least give me a chance.
How many slices of meat would you like?
I've always wanted to try it.
They will be safe with me.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
You don't have to work today.
I figure that there is no point in trying to persuade him.
He is in love with her.
She writes to me once a month.
It's just your imagination.
She fooled him.
I'm not at all surprised.
Astronomy deals with the stars and planets.
I did nothing.
Several people are already waiting.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
Strictly speaking, the tomato is a fruit.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
This pear smells nice.
I think this belongs to you.
Don't be a chicken.
Please speak French.
Why are you always whining?
It's dead.
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
It's a complicated subject.
Can this wait till morning?
It's not the sort of illness that puts your life at risk.
He pretended not to be hurt.
Try to make the most of your time.
We must sit down.
I just don't want to overdo it.
I want to fight.
Tom showed me Mary's picture.
It was wise of you to take your umbrella with you.
Lock the office.
Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library.
They are all the same.
The fireman could not extinguish the flames.
It smells like bleach.
Let me bring you up to speed.
I like it when you do that.
When do you use it?
A cat was sleeping in the bass drum.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than Mary is.
I thought we'd have fun together.
Crows all but destroyed the farmer's field of corn.
Is he correct?
I want a licensed guide who speaks English.
It's not worth the effort.
My neighbors are very nice people.
The movie hasn't started yet.
We all wished for peace.
You're not too late.
He visited Kyoto last year.
I feel happy when I'm with you.
All we need is a little patience.
Tom tiptoed past his parents' bedroom.
She started for Kyoto yesterday.
Tom called to say that he'd be late.
They called them scalawags.
My mother has been dead these ten years.
You'd better take care of it.
That meal was simply divine.
Go back to bed.
No one could solve the puzzle.
Tom told Mary he wasn't married.
You could have told me.
We're leaving Boston.
Turn around, please.
I want to stay outside.
They do it each week.
He left his keys in the car.
Tom said he wasn't ready to become a father.
I'm going to need some more money.
My uncle now lives in comfort.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Be realistic!
I love summer.
Tom calls me every night.
I know him by name, but not by sight.
You're lazy.
You're very angry.
Get my rifle.
What more could you want?
Can you determine what happened?
Do you have a larger size?
I took it for granted that you were on our side.
I've been wanting to ask you a question.
Keep it.
I love him, but he loves someone else.
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
Be merciful.
She has always been a popular actress.
The TV doesn't work.
I know it's not easy.
I caught the last bus.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
I fell in the pool.
May I charge my cell phone somewhere around here?
I would like to repay him for his kindness.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
You're a filthy liar!
Hey guys, it's getting late.
How many books do you have?
She'll love him forever.
The desk seems small in this room.
Bite the bullet.
I do things in my own way.
Just call me when you're done.
I allowed her to go to the party.
It's an old picture.
Why is it important to recycle?
She has wet hair.
I had my birthday party at a restaurant.
They've bet the farm on it.
He ran to school, arriving in time.
She works for French intelligence.
Are you happy here?
She was robbed of her purse.
Is there a cat under the table?
You lied to me.
Where did you put my umbrella?
Are you afraid of that?
She is hard on them.
You're not married, are you?
The lake is deepest here.
I appreciate your patience.
Just follow them.
Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia in 1910.
It's a surprise.
You came in late.
Have you ever been to an opera?
Please give me a hand.
He is not stupid.
We've got better things to do with our time.
I've never seen you laugh.
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
Tom is kind and generous.
No one is too old to learn French.
She came downstairs with a letter in her hand.
Every student in the class knows the fact.
Tom has moved to Boston.
I object to her going there alone.
He's always worrying about his daughter.
It was all a big mistake.
Tom started shaking.
You're doing it right.
His death was partly my fault.
I don't think we can afford it now.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
No one cheated.
They were playing tennis.
This car won't start.
What're you drinking?
I heard you switched majors.
It is on this point that our opinions differ.
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
I regret a lot of things.
Take whatever you want.
If I could stay longer, I would.
I liked your friends.
Had you been drinking?
Has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem?
He works in a bank.
That's pretty annoying.
I thought I was going crazy.
That remains a possibility.
I think Tom did well.
You've been infected.
Let Tom do his job.
It appears that he is a musician.
I don't see how that is any of your business.
I always walk.
Let us help you do that.
How is the weather?
I don't think I'll be bored.
Creationism is a pseudo-science.
This happened to us, too.
Lock the door behind me.
Don't touch me, you pig!
Tom isn't really sick. He's just pretending to be.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're very direct.
They can't hurt you now.
Do you speak French?
I can see the light.
I've got nothing in my fridge.
A watched pot never boils.
Where is Boston?
He said that I must go.
They want to become rich.
That's all I'm thinking about.
Are you kidding?
Don't you understand what's going on here?
Would you mind not doing that?
I was Mr. Jackson's student.
It's more dangerous than I thought.
I hope I will become a dentist in the future.
Are they taking good care of you?
She found me a good seat.
I want to have a job that I love.
You can say whatever you want to.
Do you think that eating breakfast every day is important?
Tom was one of the invited guests.
I'm blessed.
Are you thirsty?
Don't judge me.
Where's all that money going?
I've seen all your movies.
I never saw him again.
Would you say they match?
I will deal with them myself.
Where's my tie?
We love them.
The boy carved his name into the tree.
Tom told me you hit him.
I didn't think anyone was home.
I don't want to shoot you.
You didn't get very far.
It was too small.
Don't look down on him just because he's poor.
Are you talking shop?
I slept with my clothes on.
You're welcome.
I lit the match.
It smells good!
I'm not going to be able to finish this before 2:30.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
His house is by the river.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
I must go alone.
He did as I told him.
I got up earlier than usual.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
Why didn't you go to the police?
Tom is a slow walker.
I don't think Tom will believe Mary.
Tom doesn't want to go to school today.
Let me deal with him.
It isn't a dream.
Do you understand what's going on?
Would you like another glass of ice tea?
I always have a look at the newspaper before breakfast.
He touched my shoulder.
They saluted each other by raising their hats.
Tom had a knife in his hand.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
It is not polite to point at others.
His argument was logical.
Tell me what I have to do.
Are you an only child?
You know the law.
Do you drink coffee?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Don't shoot.
My younger brother is watching TV.
She will be back within a week.
I was trying to talk to you.
My physician advised me to refrain from alcohol for the time being.
Bring wine.
The English class system is known for its snobbery.
We organized a huge party.
I have something of yours.
We have the extra-large size, but not in that color.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind.
I have made up my mind to leave Japan.
I've done everything you've asked.
Tom is such a coward.
You can trust us.
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
He dislikes unexpectedness and emergencies of any kind.
Where did you guys go?
There's a fire in the building. We have to evacuate immediately.
Tom is still in shock.
I left my bag here.
Tom kissed Mary and she slapped him.
You're too suspicious about everything.
I never imagined meeting you here.
Choose your weapon.
I want this garbage out of here.
I like your painting.
I'll send flowers.
It is wrong to steal money.
I want you to destroy all this.
Is that a possibility?
Tom could've killed you if he'd wanted to.
Let's call the whole thing off.
It is up to me to tell the sad news to her.
His eyes were full of tears.
I can't accept this.
You'll be safe with him.
The letter was written by Tom.
You're not bad.
The landlord changed the locks.
They're terrified of you.
I like castles.
Tom is still very unhappy.
We don't have any bread left.
What happens if I press this button?
I want you to take a good look around.
Is the customer always right?
A storm is brewing.
Don't be so angry.
Can you identify this?
I don't find that funny.
That's the fastest train in the world.
One thing you should know about me is that I'm obsessed with punctuality.
I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?
Is that likely?
He's a bartender.
He had no memory of the accident.
Spit it out, Tom.
If people who smoke are deprived of their cigarettes, they get nervous and irritable.
I feel like I'm not wanted.
Tom lives in a small town not too far from Boston.
He proposal was not acceptable.
I don't know exactly where.
Can we just drop it?
He's eating an apple.
The cat is in the well.
Tie your shoelaces.
I fell from a tree.
Everyone is ready.
They both want to say something.
All things taken into consideration, my father's life was a happy one.
I saw a plane.
Try to jump as high as possible.
You're so mean.
Tom found the book Mary had given him quite boring.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
You need to be careful.
Tom showed Mary the ropes.
The heat is overwhelming.
I hear you're good at French.
I was watching videos.
The new students entered the hall full of hope.
Do you want children?
I know how this works.
She advised him not to go there by himself.
You love that house, don't you?
The heat's preventing me from sleeping.
How do you eat like that without gaining weight?
They are on good terms with each other.
I've always dreamed of owning my own business.
The money's on the table.
The prime minister spoke about the financial crisis at length.
I have some good news for you.
What did Tom offer you?
What's your beef?
This is his house.
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
I think we've already wasted too much time.
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know.
Do you remember what to do?
If it is worth doing, do it well.
Could you leave me one?
I have no idea who he is.
I can't wait to leave.
I like it when you do that.
I write in my diary every day.
I hear Tom was the one who taught you how to play the cello.
I don't like what he said.
Money is welcome everywhere.
I'll drive Tom home.
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
She held her baby in her arms.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
Did I win?
It's a fascinating read.
Strive to be happy.
This is boring.
We're all to blame for that.
Did you talk to your new classmates yesterday?
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
I think life is what you make it.
The sky is becoming cloudy.
Tom has been called away on business.
I'll be at the hospital.
Nobody's forcing you to do anything.
Why are you doing this?
He is qualified as an English teacher.
Misfortunes rarely come singly.
Hand me the remote.
Do you know why she's so angry?
Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today.
What do you want to do?
The baby is asleep.
Why are you all so busy?
I finished the work yesterday.
He made for the door.
Am I wrong?
We need information.
There's no right answer.
Workers at the company went on a strike.
Tom gave them a general idea of what he wanted.
Did you like the movie?
She has traveled all over the globe.
Do not say such foolish things.
Don't forget to attach your photo to the application form.
There are many tall buildings in that town.
Do you feel it, too?
The dog must stay outside!
You're really awesome.
I've been trying to find out who was responsible for the accident.
Tom isn't sure where to go.
Life is hard.
It is almost three.
It was a relief.
They have to live on his small income.
I don't like to take on the heavy responsibilities.
She's wearing a hat.
She refused his offer.
Stop the car now.
We count on you.
I know you must be afraid.
Children need a lot of sleep.
Come what may, I won't change my opinion.
I was rereading the letters you sent to me.
There is no room for romance in my life.
Would you wait a second?
Tom verified the date of the meeting.
Have a nice day, Tom.
About how much money do you need?
Tom has to go home.
Do you love me?
I don't think I can help you.
You may go anywhere.
I think you went too far.
It is cold.
Tom is very efficient.
I used to have a motorcycle.
Tom doesn't like being told he's not old enough yet.
She kept on talking.
I didn't know you were staying at this hotel.
I don't see any blood.
Maybe it's a trap.
I'd like to talk to someone about what I saw.
Did you check all the items on the shopping list?
That's the last thing you want.
I think that he is right.
Turn left at the next corner.
Your ideas are weird.
I enjoyed it very much.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
I'll act as a guide for you.
He has already begun.
You told us she was kind and she really is.
We nearly starved.
They are the ones who want to go.
How did you come by this painting?
I have too many things on my mind these days.
It's just your imagination.
We've done a lot.
A fire broke out during that night.
Call me if anything changes.
I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
I have three dogs. One is male and the other two are female.
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
Is this your first time in Japan?
From now on, let's eat lunch in the kitchen.
I think we should all go inside.
This music is making me sleepy.
You must be very hungry now.
If he had been free, he would have gone fishing.
I loved that.
I really don't envy you.
I think we found it.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
Almost all of the dogs are alive.
I'm patient.
She didn't even try to help.
I can't do that.
According to our teacher, she entered the hospital.
Tom knew that Mary was rich.
He has long legs.
I agreed to help him in his work.
I’ve always wanted to have a pet squirrel.
Two problems remained unsolved.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
We want to know who's the best.
I'm a bit hungry.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
You're a very good teacher.
Tom is worried about what might happen.
I have just finished eating lunch.
You should've done that.
You didn't prepare me for this.
You're cheating.
We're conscientious.
I don't think they did this.
My older sister got engaged.
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one.
I enjoyed your company.
I don't understand women.
Can I be your friend?
Between meals, he usually manages to stow away a generous supply of candy, ice cream, popcorn and fruit.
They are good people.
Go straight ahead and you will see the bank.
I've been waiting a long time.
Please don't tell my wife.
They were wealthy.
The well is dry.
Where is Paris?
I have made him angry.
I'm shorter than you.
Our team did not reach the playoffs this year.
Why does Tom drink so much?
The contract was signed.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
He asked about you.
Were you aware of this?
Tom can't use this.
He isn't my cousin.
I must go to work early today.
That pleases me very much.
My hobby is music.
He was very poor.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
He will be ten next April.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker no matter how much I try.
Is that your mother?
It's not worth the money.
I could use some help in the kitchen.
He asked about you.
I'll tell you a secret.
He's not in.
We went to the café that I told you about.
Are you surprised?
I still believe the Internet is not a place for children.
Let me explain how this works.
They are aware of the difficulties.
We have no comment.
They set up a new company in London.
He drives me crazy.
You don't want much, do you?
Who will come with me?
They missed the deadline.
I feel really stupid.
Please telephone him.
I can recommend this restaurant.
He didn't want to part with his house.
How long will that be?
She asked me to pass her the salt.
You're very efficient.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
I don't want you to change a thing.
Tom became weak.
I try not to use more paper than I need.
My mother made a sweater for me.
This desk is a little too low for me.
It's a common mistake.
I'm sorry, the flight is full.
Take out your notebooks.
This is extremely important.
We traveled together.
We all want changes.
I gave my father a silk tie.
When did I give you that?
I advise you never to live beyond your income.
Since there are rice paddies near my house, I often hear frogs croaking all night long this time of year.
I can't do all of this without help.
I would've drowned if you hadn't saved me.
This tastes like tea.
I've got to skedaddle or I'll be late.
Here comes the waiter.
I hope everyone agrees.
I'll have to work hard.
I was just leaving.
I'm pressing charges.
Stay in your room.
You lied to me.
A famous architect built this house.
I'm going to bed.
This candy costs eighty cents.
It was our secret.
Write down your date of birth here.
He was panting.
Those are our teachers' cars.
Don't trust him no matter what he says.
Last summer, I worked part time on a farm.
I know you're not coming to my party, but I wish you were.
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
We're looking for someone.
Get out of here! All of you!
I have not been able to find a job so far.
I really like that.
We're astonished.
Look who's talking.
That's very cute.
Your dress is touching the wet paint.
There was no taxi, so I had to walk home.
I haven't gotten rid of my bad cold yet.
I'll sue you.
My father bought me a bicycle.
His success was largely due to good luck.
It matters to me.
This book is really old.
Do you think I don't care?
I'm in way over my head.
I just don't want any of these.
I am only joking.
Can I call you again?
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
You take my breath away.
What's your horse's name?
He hardly works.
Will it rain this afternoon?
Who's watching?
I don't see it that way.
Did you read it all?
How much does it cost?
Could you call a doctor, please?
We will visit our teacher next week.
He's fluent in Japanese.
What's wrong with it?
I heard someone call my name.
Try this cake.
Just water, please.
He let go of the rope.
I'd hate to be in your shoes.
What did you want to talk with me about?
Did I hurt your feelings?
It's hard to understand you.
I barely know anything about you.
If the medicine isn't working, maybe we should up the dosage.
"How long will the meeting last?" "For two hours."
I think you might need me.
We understand that completely.
You're a funny man.
I am the chosen one.
I can't get the cap off this bottle.
I got my bicycle repaired.
They live in this town.
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
We found Tom's umbrella.
We'll have to pull an all-nighter.
He can only pay twenty dollars at most.
I do not think that she is at home.
Get the box.
She's a smart girl.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
Did you think about our offer?
You're not in a hurry, are you?
He received quite a few letters this morning.
When my wife finds out, she won't be happy.
He has hardly any money, but he gets by.
Are you ready to go out?
He was too tired to study.
Would you like to have lunch with me?
We want peace.
Are you allowed to go?
You could've ruined everything.
I know exactly who it is.
I can't stand getting beaten.
Not everybody wants to be an artist.
They're in trouble.
Of the eight, only one was found guilty.
Can you tell me who they are?
You need to be prepared.
Mother and child are both doing well.
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?
Ask the policeman.
She has the same bag as you have.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
I look forward to reading your new novel.
I am fine.
I have the ace of clubs.
I go to a driving school.
I have to go to the city.
I'll leave.
A dog's sense of smell is much keener than a human's.
We all want you back.
The play was based on a true story.
Hurry up, please.
I think we should call the police.
He would sit for hours reading detective stories.
You're my best friend.
Don't ask who she is.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you.
Don't trust anybody.
He would like to know whether you play chess.
Make it smaller.
His name is known all over the country.
Everybody here knows everybody else.
I have lost the key.
I can't ignore my commanding officer's orders.
I was planning to call him, but changed my mind and didn't.
How did you come up with such a good idea?
Life is a dream.
That was a nice speech.
I want you to find out about that.
Waiter, I need a spoon.
I bet we'll have a test today.
We still have to look for the hook.
You'd better check that.
A computer is a complex machine.
I'll treat you.
It was really funny.
Before going to work in Paris, I must brush up on my French.
Where's the catch?
Are you waiting for Tom?
What am I supposed to do with them?
She put sheets on her bed.
Why are you standing there?
The commander refused to negotiate.
My cholesterol went down.
I was fired in 2013.
I feel that something is wrong.
Do you think Tom can find it?
My sister works at the United States Embassy in London.
Did you go to Tom's party last Saturday?
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
He knows the truth.
It was a busy day.
Fry an egg for me.
This puzzle has 500 pieces.
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
Read the article.
I won't let you go there.
Is there a pen on the desk?
I have a table.
I've got a question.
Do you have any employees who speak French?
Our school library has many books.
They can't do that.
Tom told me that he would leave soon.
This bracelet is very inexpensive.
They grow fruit here.
Tom's house is very big.
Taking a taxi is a luxury for me.
Let's establish some ground rules.
He is good for nothing.
We're all afraid.
Let's make a cake.
Please find out where she is.
Did you rent an apartment?
I have no idea what to expect.
I'm between jobs.
He runs a lot of hotels.
I think you must be getting tired.
We're nearly there.
You are taller than me.
That does make me feel better.
Show us the way.
Did anyone care?
I think Tom is likely to go to Boston in the near future.
No one asked your opinion.
A good idea occurred to him.
I'd like the bill, please.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
Does it work?
I remember seeing you last year.
I share his opinion.
Please be honest.
A fat man seldom dislikes anybody very hard or for very long.
I need to go back to Boston for a funeral.
Why didn't you go to the police?
You'll find yourself in a miserable situation.
Where do they live?
I'm not unsympathetic.
What did you do this time?
Let's establish some ground rules.
We have lots of important things to do.
I could use a drink.
There is no school during August.
I just got here.
I read that report before lunch.
I answered the door.
Change is possible.
You're too stupid to live.
Which car is yours?
Tom hasn't been married long.
When will we arrive in Tokyo?
Tom speaks to his father in French and his mother in English.
She brags about how well she can cook.
I was waiting for that question.
There's nothing unusual to report.
Report to the emergency room.
Tom's warned me about that.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
He hung up.
Turn right at the next corner.
I'm going to church.
Your friends sound nice.
Is he interested in me?
I wish I had eaten more.
Thank you very much for your present.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Is this all yours?
Can I ask you something personal?
I'm just curious.
Do you feel any better?
It's freezing in here.
I really want to thank you.
I agreed to do it.
It's not that different.
She greeted us with a smile.
She goes to night school.
He may be sick in bed.
Where do you get off telling me that?
They chatted about the weather.
Are things going well?
I won!
I spent 100 dollars today.
When did you take the exam?
Sanitary conditions in the refugee camps were terrible.
I took him to the most expensive restaurant on campus.
What do I get in return?
We're no longer working for Tom.
They are out shopping.
I really like French cooking.
He does not seem to be very tired.
I have a flat tire.
I need more room.
I was really tired so I went to bed early.
Tom eats a plant-based diet.
Let's hope there are no more acts of vandalism.
You talk too much.
Do you have a snow shovel?
Mary is expecting a baby in October.
Tom wasn't able to sleep on the bus.
I feel hungry.
It's against the rules.
Are you sure we have enough beer?
Whose notebook is that?
Do you feel birthdays are important?
I have enclosed your order form.
It was the proudest moment of my life.
Don't touch me!
The building that I saw was very large.
I haven't finished my breakfast yet.
I don't know the way.
Did Tom kill himself?
That's not what I signed up for.
Tom keeps hanging up on me.
I've had enough.
I know none of them.
Athletes usually abstain from smoking.
Tom's bag was very light.
Do you think I'm to blame?
I repeated my name.
How do you know what I said?
I knew who did it.
In the automotive industry of the 1970's, Japan beat the U.S. at its own game.
I don't want Mary to leave me.
The doctor advised me to take more exercise.
Try to do your best.
Our ancestors came to this country 150 years ago.
It's hard to throw things out.
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
It's now a habit.
My camera is much better than yours.
I want to know how this happened and why.
It may be that he is not a bad man.
She is late.
She put some of the ointment on her hands.
He wondered why she did that.
I already know how to dance.
I thought I recognized you.
I can't put up with all that noise.
How much is it going to cost?
I think you're nuts.
Take me to your place.
Tom got his teeth whitened.
I'm not exactly surprised.
They gave him both material and spiritual support.
Why don't you talk to me now?
I must know the truth about him.
It's yours.
She has faults, too.
Paparazzi thronged both sides of the red carpet.
What are you going to do if it rains?
I thought she was 30 at most.
Paris, which is on the Seine, is a beautiful city.
Look here.
We stayed at a nice hotel.
Yesterday I happened to run into Tom on the street.
They showed it to our company.
His face turned white.
I feel very strongly about that.
I'm the one who met him.
I'm a French teacher.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
My father will support me financially.
I got married 8 years ago.
I told you it was going to be easy.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I just want you to be OK.
I'm more experienced than Tom.
Without you, I would've died.
I saw the file.
I took care of my sick sister.
They'll be rooting for you.
Prisons are euphemistically called rehabilitation centers.
It's a nice thought.
What are you doing these days?
Tom lit the candles.
Don't tempt me.
You probably wouldn't understand this.
Tom drinks wine.
I cannot find time to read the book.
He stood with his back to the wall.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
What a perfect night!
I feel better today.
What are some good foods to eat with potatoes?
Do you want to watch this movie again?
Please keep this door locked.
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
They invited them to dinner.
I hung my coat in the hall closet.
His car was seriously damaged.
Tom will find you.
I brought you this.
He made for the door and tried to escape.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
The slaughter of the prisoners was a barbarous act.
I'd like to pay you back.
He's always running short of cash.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
The baby started to cry.
Tom and I aren't friends. We're just coworkers.
Keep an eye on the boys. They're mischievous.
She met him on the beach.
I lead a busy life.
Mommy, if I don't like the food, do I have to eat it?
I heard him speak fluent English.
The boy bowed to me.
I want you to leave me alone.
He came all the way to talk over a problem with me.
Tom's story keeps changing.
He left his umbrella in the bus.
Sign this.
How does it work?
I think about you often.
I'll tell you what to say.
Whales feed on small fish.
You dropped something.
That's all changed now.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Tom takes everything too seriously.
I love the way you write.
She was advised by him not to go.
It looks like you've lost a few pounds.
I feel lucky to have been chosen.
Why didn't you call me up?
I'm just curious.
I'll take you to the hospital.
The athletic meet was postponed due to rain.
Is this a joke?
Don't forget us.
I can't imagine it.
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner.
It wasn't what I wanted.
There is no need for us to hurry.
I'm not all that drunk.
Put the garbage outside.
Does that mean yes?
My husband is a good man.
Tom deserved the punishment he got.
Someday you'll regret this.
The check, please.
He is afraid to swim.
How come she hung up on you?
That last round of chemo really sapped his energy.
Did the police arrest Tom?
I'm not in trouble.
The collection is open to the public.
Who can run fastest in your class?
She cried bitterly.
Can I talk to you a second?
It was impolite of him to do so.
He's a lovely young man.
What will the neighbors say?
She broke the cup, too.
I don't think I can help you.
I am taking a couple of days off.
I'm not gambling anymore.
I didn't know you were awake.
May I use your telephone?
We're not married.
He took off his coat.
Defend her from danger.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
You're trustworthy.
Tom isn't going to wait.
You are selling him short.
Did I give you enough time?
I have met him many times.
This could take a while.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
It could be anybody.
I have so much to show you.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
He works from nine to five-thirty.
It's now or never.
I can't identify it.
Everything is broken.
I don't usually dress like this.
He assumed full responsibility.
Do you recognize them?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Who's on your list?
He knows a lot about animals.
Can't we have a snack or something?
Hey, what was that all about?
You look like you're about to throw up.
Tom said you wanted to talk to me.
I don't know that much about you.
It was the increase in population that caused the poverty.
I am dying to see her again.
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
Several American warships were sent to Panama.
You are curious, aren't you?
This house is large enough for your family to live in.
This is a doghouse that I made myself.
If I had wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it.
No matter how tired I might be, I have to work.
Last night, I read a book.
This road curves gently to the right.
I like English better.
I like dark red better.
I know you don't know how to speak French.
I'm friends with a lot of them.
You're out of your mind.
I must leave tomorrow morning.
Beautiful woman, isn't she?
When can I see you again?
Were you excited?
Please close the door behind you.
There is no use talking to her.
Almost no one believed her.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Stay a little longer.
He had his secretary type the report.
I'm glad you brought that up.
He gives her everything she asks for.
I'll keep your advice in mind.
Even though my friend was a vegetarian, I didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it.
This is pointless.
We were right.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Tom looks like his mother.
My mother made me a sweater.
Tom says he'll correct it.
Tom is very mean.
They will agree on that.
I'll let you know when she arrives.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
I'm not quite sure how to do that.
You cannot do this.
Are you going by bus or car?
I came to Tokyo three years ago and have been living here ever since.
You are the chosen one.
Everybody needs one.
I asked her if she could go to the party.
I have many model cars.
I urge caution.
It isn't that bad.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
What a wonderful town!
Can I help?
I don't know anyone in Boston.
Did you really do that?
I'm sure Tom did his best.
I have many model cars.
There's a spider in the shower.
The photographs are the only proof we have.
I'm laying you off.
I fell asleep.
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
We're ruthless.
I cannot agree with you on the matter.
She always speaks to him in a loud voice because he's hard of hearing.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
Don't tell anyone.
I should take a look.
He is by far the wisest of the three.
What I want is some peace and quiet.
That is the same umbrella as I found on the bus.
That can happen sometimes.
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
How are things going?
I think my boyfriend is spying on my emails.
This letter is addressed to you.
I am glad that you have returned safe.
That's not something I want to do.
I beg your pardon?
You've worked hard.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
I like to sleep on my stomach.
What was it that brought you to me?
Get Tom to help you.
Are there any Chinese restaurants near here?
You're no longer allowed to speak.
The mouse ran underneath the bed.
I get out of the hospital next week.
Are you all set to leave?
I don't know when I can take a break.
Are you about done?
I opened the box, but it was empty.
I told you it wasn't over.
I should do it.
I thought I knew you.
I don't want to see you here again.
Tom drinks coffee every day.
I don't feel like playing.
I have no clue.
They had a spat yesterday.
How much is the rent?
I can't believe that I'm really here.
Tell me where you went.
You can't give Tom that.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
He seems very pleasant.
Come see me again tomorrow.
She'll tell him about it when she comes back.
I don't know why they do it.
He asked me for my phone number.
The choice is all up to you.
I've been watching you study.
If your schedule permits, let’s tentatively plan on meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm.
Don't feed the dog.
Most writers are sensitive to criticism.
A great warrior radiates strength. He doesn't have to fight to the death.
We'll all be there together.
I'll come and see you one of these days.
Don't follow me.
I thought you'd be grateful.
Whether you believe it or not, I believe it.
My sister saw it with her own eyes.
What was it that brought you to me?
I'm very sad.
Is there a museum in this town?
Tom never trusted Mary.
We got lost in the fog.
What did you say?
He's so young.
I'm too busy to help Tom.
I sometimes watch TV.
Do you mind if I turn on the TV?
Don't be fresh to me.
The most common name in the world is Mohammed.
I drive.
You don't need to go there.
I wanted to speak to you about this.
Are you traveling alone?
The matter is really pressing.
I don't think Tom will be at school tomorrow.
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
I suppose it was a bit silly.
She didn't want to sell the book.
Does Tom plan to help us?
He raised a question.
More than 40 percent of the students go to university.
Do you like fish?
Why are you staying?
French bread is delicious.
You look a little shaken.
I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
How is your last name written?
What on earth were you thinking, bringing him here?
There's something I think you need to know.
Did you choose an interesting book for your son?
Our world is only a tiny part of the universe.
Drink some tea.
You are carrying your joke a bit too far.
I saw him cross the road.
What I'm telling you is true.
He watched the boys swimming.
Don't talk to anybody about this.
I often think about the place where I met you.
Which film did you see?
She feeds her dog a meat-free diet.
Tell me how I can help you.
We're normal.
Don't lose your purse.
He stayed out of public life.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
I have homework.
Tom pounded on the door.
It's raining there.
He has a nice personality.
An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
If you invite him, he may come.
I really want to figure this out.
It tasted sweet.
He can also speak Russian.
We have to talk about this.
It's all I know.
She has a cold and is absent from school.
Tom doesn't want to eat lunch now.
I don't have anything new.
She drowned herself in some lake.
Stop acting like a child.
Are you a member of this crew?
This oil painting dates from the 17th century.
I didn't know that I had to do that.
You're very stylish.
Stay back.
You're very busy.
I made these.
Do you understand me?
I always take a bath in the morning.
We don't have time to waste.
Most of this building's tenants are artists.
Let me deal with him.
Open the window, will you?
When did your father come home?
He delivered a very long speech yesterday.
Close your eyes again.
She has gone shopping.
They all hugged.
I awoke to find a burglar in my room.
You can't handle this alone.
He also saw it.
It would be best if you didn't do that.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
It's a secret, I guess.
He did it for the money.
He speaks French fluently.
Don't say such things.
I have come to kill you.
I can't tell you who's on the list. My boss told me not to.
I had a good time yesterday.
What's your problem with Tom?
All roads lead to Rome.
At last, we reached the summit.
I want the money you owe me and I want it now.
That market has been rapidly expanding.
If you mix blue and red, you'll get purple.
That's a beautiful story.
Rules are made to be broken.
Don't be so impatient.
He made an important discovery.
I'll buy a Ford.
I still need to talk to you.
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
Were you with anyone?
You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?
I wish you the best of luck.
They gave a piece of cake to Tom.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
My girlfriend is Chinese.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
Don't underestimate my power.
We just need to stay calm.
She does not have many friends in Kyoto.
You're very lonely.
I'm a natural blonde.
Whose bicycle is that?
My father is proud of the fact that he's never been in a traffic accident.
I had to give it a try.
The students laughed.
You cannot be too careful about spelling.
Is the university's library open now?
His reply was negative.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
You don't have to answer.
We're rich.
Do you believe in UFOs?
My parents want me to come home.
What should I wear?
What are you lining up for?
Tom died about a year ago.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
I have two brothers and two sisters.
Tom doesn't look pleased.
She requested help, but no one came.
I had to see you.
They despise you.
Tom is reading in his bedroom.
Tom quietly opened the door and tiptoed into the room.
I should've listened to you.
Why do you wear a watch?
That's the only thing that's important.
The cat jumped onto the table.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
He exposed himself to danger.
How thick is the board?
Who are you there with?
The wind died away.
Call me back.
Have you seen my keys?
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Tom is going to beat you.
We are the best.
Tom was dumped.

Tom is a very good guitarist, isn't he?
What did they hit you with?
My parents met each other in the mountains.
Taste it.
I think it's too cold to swim.
I don't want you to quit because of me.
Why didn't you tell me that last night?
Do you want to go to the station with me?
If you need anything, just call.
I'm right behind you.
I really need you.
The national debt has trebled in the last ten years.
None of them know French.
Tom certainly had an interesting story to tell.
I'm not a drunk.
I don't live in Finland.
I want you to have this.
She was dressed all in black.
Are you all set for the trip?
Perhaps I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
Tom left.
Is this my life?
I was here first.
The food is delicious.
I warned you once.
Let them do their job.
I'd say we are definitely going to have a good time tonight.
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
Do you want to know why I lied to Tom?
Your bath is ready.
This medication works instantly.
Is it always hot like this?
Don't drink too much, okay?
King Solomon was known for his wisdom.
I'm getting too old for this.
All we need is water.
She will be a college student next spring.
This ink is the best.
You're the one who trained me.
Why wouldn't we do that?
He promised to provide information.
I think I'm prepared for that.
I speak English every day.
How long does a bear sleep?
I have two cars.
First of all, I'm very worried about my daughter's health.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Be quiet while I am speaking.
Tom stole the ring.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Tom never sleeps.
The surgeon amputated the wrong leg.
I really do appreciate it.
I love this store.
Do you want me to be your bodyguard?
I don't want to be your friend.
That's not entirely true, is it?
Can we change rooms?
I figured you'd want to know.
I'm going to do something else.
You'll forget about me someday.
They accused me of being a liar.
Did you do something new with your hair?
What do you have against those people?
I'll put in a word for you.
I'd like you to look after my dog.
Are you attempting to bribe me?
"Why are you angry?" "I'm not angry!"
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I could help.
Tom didn't have the courage to disobey Mary.
Are you implying something?
Are you out of your mind?
I had dinner with a friend last night.
It's a bad time.
Do you have plans for dinner?
How much does this umbrella cost?
I like walking.
We'll obey.
It looked awful.
They are very cheerful.
They were ready to run the risk of being shot by the enemy.
I live in Tahiti.
No one knew Tom was there.
This is twice as large as that.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
She advised him to go to the police station.
His knees gave way.
Look, I'm not interested.
Don't ramble.
My girlfriend was crying.
Everything is negotiable.
Call the cops.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I missed a lot.
I've got something better in mind.
That's true, too.
When I got up, the sun was already high in the sky.
I'm too short to reach the top shelf.
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
We used to play in the park.
I shouldn't drink.
You still have a chance.
It will be snowing tomorrow.
I don't know Boston that well.
Where were you coming from?
I did not read a book yesterday.
He takes the attitude that resistance is a waste of energy.
He was supposed to come.
I'm going to take this.
I want you to be my friend again.
What a pity you can't dance!
I'll be out of town next week.
I didn't want my mom to know.
No one knew what to do.
They'll never make it.
Keep the door open.
I should've paid attention.
He said he could do it.
Are you trying to scare me?
Please do not smoke here.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
Keep up with the times.
Tom is madly in love with Mary.
Now for my next number, I'd like to play a song for you that I learned from my father.
Sometimes I hear voices.
Don't blame the victim.
The hostages will be released tomorrow.
I wish there were a better translation of this book.
Nobody can hear you.
Do it again!
If you want me to, I'll do that for you.
We caught you.
We've been waiting all morning.
I don't know how you did it.
I just figured out who you are.
I had to work last weekend.
I'm too scared to say anything.
Tom's car is on fire.
Who gave you this?
They're in trouble.
I was disqualified.
Raise your hand.
I didn't see any children in the park.
There are no more bullets in my gun.
How was your summer?
Tom refused to sign the document.
He is at the office.
Tom comes here every three days.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Even Tom lied.
He was hard to please.
I didn't say I liked Tom.
Tom can ski as well as his brother.
Smog hung over Tokyo.
They're having a going-out-of-business sale.
I'm immune.
Do you think I should go by myself?
Local shops do good business with tourists.
It sounded easy.
Did you prefer Volume One or Volume Two?
I didn't need anyone's help.
Tom committed crimes, but was never convicted.
I didn't think you needed one.
This doesn't burn.
There you are.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.
This bicycle is mine.
We have until October to complete our plan.
It's only effective at close range.
It's an emergency.
The meeting isn't over.
His death surprised us all.
Do I make myself clear?
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
I can't really describe it.
Are you up?
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
They go into town every Saturday.
Tom likes to watch baseball games on TV.
Tom works at a hospital near here.
I always wanted to be different.
Why are you so busy today?
I won't touch a thing.
The church bells are ringing.
Do you think I'm fat?
Tom should've told Mary that he was married.
What is your house like?
Tom sat down on the sofa.
No one noticed.
I'm certainly not your friend.
I figured you might want this.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
Who hired you?
When did you become a teacher?
Stop it. You're making me blush.
He missed his flight.
Where do you live?
Are you sure everyone's already left?
You're very intelligent.
When did you get back from Boston?
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
It's ours.
Your plan didn't work.
Do we have time for a cup of coffee?
Turn left at the second traffic light.
English is spoken all over the world.
You have to obey the law.
You'll be the first to know.
I'm glad to have a roof over my head.
It was very disappointing.
We have not yet discussed which method is better.
This would've been your room if you'd decided to stay with us.
That's not what I'm looking for.
Learning English is hard work.
Don't you know his name?
Answer my question.
I know now what we have to do.
There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
Someone has to do it.
She became a mother when she was fifteen years old.
I'm more than a friend.
I'm a member.
You need to be more careful.
I love my job.
Call them this evening.
Who have you told so far?
We're not done.
That dress looks really nice on you.
He stood aside for her to enter.
It's not possible to do two things at once.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
I can't let you in there.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
He fills the bill.
In the light of what you told us, I think we should revise our plan.
Do you miss it?
I awoke on the floor.
Please excuse my being late.
I feel ready for the challenge.
What a big dog!
I'd like to believe that's true.
I don't think people should make a mountain of a mole hill.
They study in the afternoon.
I just don't really understand.
He brought his dog to school.
Did I make the team?
The baby is sleeping.
Tom arrived first.
She may use this typewriter.
He likes swimming in the summer.
When was the last time you slept more than ten hours?
Whenever they meet, they quarrel.
I strongly advise you to use this.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
Bring me a sheet of paper, please.
His only wish was to see his son one last time.
It appears to me that you put on my hat by mistake.
I don't like that either.
I was injured while I was skiing.
Please try again.
I was so happy.
Can we turn the TV off?
She didn't know what to say to him.
I am going to go to America next year.
See if the gas is turned off.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
I don't have time to do that today.
I'm not going to close the door.
We've got to take Tom to the doctor.
My parents are old.
Is this appropriate?
I think we should make a deal.
People rose in revolt against the King.
He did it willingly.
Don't run risks.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
I'm one of your employees.
These boots are expensive.
Is this permissible?
How am I going to get home?
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I'm a surfer.
Why are you acting like this?
There's no film in this camera.
There's a double standard.
I'm really looking forward to my birthday party.
My French teacher is the same age as me.
It's no use asking me for money.
You can go wherever you want to go.
I can't remember doing that.
My university has a dormitory.
He seems to have missed the point.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
The clock stopped.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
You are more stupid than I thought.
Tom is getting on your nerves, isn't he?
In case of an earthquake, turn off the gas.
Applications are due by Monday.
Take a picture.
I've been following you.
I think it's a bad idea.
Have you ever been to Africa?
I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy.
He will leave for the station an hour before the train leaves.
He was very hurt by her cruel words.
Most children love ice cream.
You're starting to annoy me.
You remind me of somebody.
I don't like this game.
Where are the shoes?
They don't like you.
All the prisoners escaped.
I love Boston.
People look at things differently depending on whether they are rich or poor.
Show me something new.
I am ready to follow you.
My father has lived in Nagoya for more than fifteen years.
Tell me the truth.
I hear she's a famous actress.
Can you hold on for a second?
I think Tom is in love with you.
My brother has a gift for painting.
Everyone's watching.
What's the most interesting job you've ever had?
If you're not happy, quit.
We had a short vacation in February.
I must admit that I was mistaken.
Cut the power off.
Do we know you?
I'm always under pressure.
I'm not surprised.
He lived to be ninety.
You should do that now.
I don't know anything about their relationship.
I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
Do you know who said that?
You didn't mean it, did you?
Please say hello to him for me.
I never asked for it.
What language were they speaking?
How come you don't know your own name?
He seemed to know everything about me.
Try to enjoy yourselves.
I hate lawyers.
We should get going.
I can't describe how I felt.
Russia is the largest country in the world.
He explained the matter to me.
Tom was late again this morning.
I'm more than just a pretty face.
He asked me who that man was.
The police are certain to get him in the end wherever he may go.
Eggs are very fragile.
I wanted Tom to leave.
I want you to keep your eyes open.
It's raining cats and dogs.
The fact is that he didn't even take the exam.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
I'm being held hostage.
They're not telling us the truth.
You aren't replaceable.
Don't be so childish.
I have never drawn anything in my life.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I got up very early this morning.
It's unnecessary.
She took her book.
Someone was here.
It's important that you hear this.
You don't have to lie.
She is two years older than you.
Tom opened the window a crack.
He lay on his back on the bed.
Run for it!
He lost his honor.
I won't let you down.
Don't trust people who praise you in your presence.
They are jealous of our success.
I do not think their plan will work out.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I'm Azerbaijani.
That's a lot!
The patient will soon recover from his illness.
I may have made a mistake.
You're very nice.
That girl looks like Mary.
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
We have no school today.
I appreciate that very much.
You're not angry, are you?
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
I don't have long.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
I'm just a plain office worker.
You can't skateboard here.
I think you can handle it.
I want to know who paid for this.
She turned off the lights.
The murderer is still at large.
Shut off the water.
You look fabulous.
I want to see you first.
Don't get any ideas.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
What time is it over there?
She is no less beautiful than her sister is.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
We have no complaints.
You are trusted by every one of us.
I have a laptop.
I'm not going to allow that.
I like short hair.
I've got eyes.
This is a terrible thing.
I came by train.
I refused for personal reasons.
He fell from the tree.
You can't do that here.
Tom didn't warn me about what might happen.
Have you looked in the bottom drawer?
Get out of my room!
Has Tom ever told you how he lost his leg?
I never saw you.
You get out only what you put in.
I can't keep doing this.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
He loves going to the theater.
Somebody touched me.
I cringed.
Are you afraid?
Gay marriage is legal here.
I've waited for this too long.
I'm not your slave.
Tom knows a lot of people.
I was a student at that time.
You're not the only one with this problem.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
I have a headache this morning.
I lost your phone number.
Tell me something that I don't know.
You have to accept your role.
I don't know who you are and I don't care.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
You are the one.
Don't pay attention to her.
Old habits die hard.
Tom just contacted us.
Pour a little wine in my glass.
My bike was stolen last night.
I got up early this morning.
It's close.
I hate these things.
No one can match him in English.
I didn't come here for that reason.
Who are you talking about?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
I want to send this by registered mail.
Why don't you loosen up?
Are you winning?
He told me where to go.
Catch me if you can.
One of the girls was left behind.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
My friend is bilingual.
That's not what I saw.
We're married to each other.
Do you have the schedule?
Art is not a luxury, but a necessity.
I can't speak French at all.
A heavy snow kept us from going to school.
OK. Go ahead.
I was present at school yesterday.
You have a secret admirer.
The weather is terrible today.
I'd like a receipt, please.
I have been working for this newspaper for 4 years.
Why don't we just sit here and talk?
I hope I don't regret this.
I didn't see you come in.
He sent me some American magazines.
Was he lying on his back?
What are you thinking about?
They won't last that long.
Tom left on Christmas Day.
I never thought that would happen.
My sister is also my best friend.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
It wasn't much of a debate.
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
Why don't you sit here?
The cops are searching for the missing documents.
You don't really want this job, do you?
This is my fate.
There's usually someone here.
What do you think you'd like to do next time?
Why are you holding my hands?
I wish we could have met under better circumstances.
The talk was peppered with scientific jargon that no one understood.
Are you famous?
I think it's a little too cold to go on a picnic.
I got a weird email.
It was long.
The instinct for survival is innate.
I can't tell you yet.
I have a chest pain.
Bring it here.
I studied for one hour.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
You used to love swimming.
It's not worth the pain.
Deal us the cards.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
He got the first prize in the contest.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
It is rude to point at others.
She came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
The subject has not yet been fully explored.
It is wrong to tell lies.
I think you're drunk.
Move out of the way.
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour.
It's a beautiful story.
I want you to be by my side.
Be nicer to your sister.
He makes it a point to remember each one of our birthdays.
There are a lot of people here.
He is likely to win the game.
Please call before you come.
What would you buy if you won the lottery?
That's what Tom told me.
I can't write anything at all.
You're alone, aren't you?
Tom gave Mary a heart-shaped cookie.
Soon nobody will have anything to do with you.
I can't stand him.
He had the nerve to take my car without asking.
I pawned my guitar to pay the rent.
Don't make me leave.
I want to be pampered.
This knife cuts well.
What kind of funeral do you want?
My mother is crazy.
Where did you have the suit made?
How come you're always so energetic?
Now I'm sad.
Do you like my new clothes?
The real heroes are us.
I love my kids.
I want to see what I'm up against.
You can't live without water.
Tom likes the ocean.
I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
His schedule has been changed.
She kept her eyes closed.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I can't understand why he left so suddenly.
I made breakfast.
I'll be absent from home in the afternoon.
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
Today is Saturday.
This is the lady who wants to see you.
What will you do when you grow up?
It was below zero this morning, but I cycled to school.
Would you like a little help?
He kept all the windows open.
Do you have your driver's license?
I did everything.
Isn't that awful?
I know Tom will be fair.
They are in the same class.
The bicycle by the door is mine.
I love this photo.
The statue was damaged.
I live just up the road.
He cleared out his desk.
He is always joking.
It's really humid, isn't it?
We're not desperate yet.
She got no answer from him.
The falling of the Berlin Wall was truly a momentous occasion.
I don't really want to pay that much for a new car.
Are there kids?
Why can't I hear?
The zipper is stuck.
Tom tried climbing the tall tree.
How's your old lady doing?
May I take a message?
We should make something like that.
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
It's not our responsibility.
This is my CD.
I would like to tell you something.
The line is busy now.
Are you frightened?
Grandmother looked very well.
That's what the boss wants.
You may now kiss the bride.
Would you care to join us?
I will testify.
He is taller than any other boy.
I thought about it a lot.
I thought we were friends.
Everything went well with him.
Is that why you're upset?
I get up at six in the morning.
Do you have a points card?
Give the money to my son.
Your answer is wrong.
It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
He wasn't long in making up his mind.
I'm interested in the history of Australia.
I messed up.
We're just tired.
She got off at the next station.
Tonight is the night.
I will be very happy to accept your invitation.
Don't lie to us.
What did they want?
Nobody'll ever find us here.
This is your chance.
He explained it in detail.
I thought it was stupid.
My mother likes tulips very much and so does my sister.
I have enough money to buy it.
All of these letters are addressed to you.
We're getting married in October.
I wish we could settle this like adults.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
You didn't tell him anything?
I don't know what to feed my dog.
I can't let you go in there alone.
Tom doesn't want to have lunch with me today.
I've never been to a professional baseball game.
He needs an umbrella.
He did not turn up after all.
I love Chinese food.
Were you one of them?
This bed is way too soft for me.
Let me check my wallet.
The rescue workers are going to hand out supplies to the victims of the earthquake.
I have a tourist visa.
The machine is out of order.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your conversation.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early.
Yesterday it rained the entire afternoon.
All her carefully made plans began to unravel one by one.
I'm sure Tom did his best.
Run fast, or you will be late for school.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
Tell me more.
There will be a math test tomorrow.
I hate this job sometimes.
I've never heard such a thing.
Do you have any non-alcoholic drinks?
I know your son.
I didn't think you'd tell me.
You don't belong here.
We went to the mountain to ski.
I apologize for this.
We swam in the lake.
I want to know why you did that.
This one is ours.
I think it's time for me to ask for her help.
May I have the key?
I'm on your side.
I know they'll all want to help you.
I can't stand her jealousy.
I didn't see anybody following us.
You watch too much TV.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
We can win.
I really like your paintings.
They don't seem happy.
How is your mother?
Can you play an instrument?
Central Park is near where I work.
I really need to talk with someone.
That's very handy.
It's a risk we'll have to take.
That's not funny at all.
Come into my room.
I think we're on the right path.
You should have locked, or at least closed, all the doors.
I'm not finished with you.
It is not so difficult as you think.
That's my car.
I really like him.
The students were all looking forward to summer vacation.
I've worked all my life.
I can't really remember.
How did you lose your arm?
Tom will always remember you.
This shirt costs ten dollars.
I will play football tomorrow.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
If you speak French, I won't understand.
I really like being with you.
I wasn't talking about you.
How long is the flight?
You're naive.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
During warm weather, sweating helps man regulate his body temperature.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
She stood as close to him as she could.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
I have a friend whose wife is a pianist.
His birthday is August 21st.
Butter and cheese are made from milk.
There was almost no color in his face.
The company presented him with a gold watch on the day he retired.
Tom owns a small advertising company.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Her mother is a wonderful pianist.
Do we have any chance?
I went shopping in town today.
What are the alternatives?
Could you draw a map for me?
I admit this may not be the best way of doing it.
What do you think about it? It'd be great!
I want the fan.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
I'd like you to have a blood test.
I want more of that.
The park is located in the center of the city.
I'd like to hear more about that.
He tucked the handkerchief in his pocket.
There isn't any milk in the glass.
I'll never forget the sight.
That type of person almost never asks for a raise.
Tom is afraid of Mary, isn't he?
She's smart and beautiful.
How did you meet him?
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I'd like to spend more time with you.
Can you help us?
She got so carried away listening to the Beatles that she missed the date with him.
Who're you looking for?
Put your coat back on.
I can assure you that you are wrong.
We received a cordial welcome from them.
Could you explain it more simply?
She hit me, not him.
Both of the windows were broken.
His hobby is collecting old stamps.
What's the problem anyway?
You shouldn't have done it.
They visited us.
He consoled himself with the thought that it might have been worse.
There's nothing I can do about it.
No one likes war.
He was standing there with a vacant look.
I might not be at tonight's party.
Be nicer to your sister.
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
I'm going to take my car.
I'm sorry I didn't make it to your party.
We have plenty of time to do that.
That seems suspicious to me.
Typhoons hit Japan every year.
Tom claimed to be Mary's son.
I don't feel like trying.
Napoleon marched his armies into Russia.
I don't need to go to the doctor.
I can't wait.
What do you like about it?
He has nothing to do.
I need to keep my eyes open.
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
I was barefoot.
I have gone astray somewhere in my calculation.
My husband is a very good cook.
You seem confident.
I want to write a book.
Those who want to remain may do so.
This shoe is a size bigger.
What if Tom finds out?
I'm plastered.
I live next to a dam.
We're joking.
I don't recall saying that.
I felt left out.
He painted his bicycle red.
Have you been smoking?
How come you didn't call me last night?
I just moved in yesterday.
We need you.
Tom was really tired.
You don't look Japanese.
Where did I put that box?
If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn.
I'd like to buy a map.
One can't help many, but many can help one.
I found Tom's diary.
You are the one.
I will come if I have time.
Pass the ball quickly to a person behind you.
You're amazing.
We were in love.
I need to search for my pen.
I understand what you're saying.
I knew you wouldn't have enough time.
We don't have time to do that today.
Raise your left hand.
Tom is competitive.
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
She was buried in her hometown.
Who was that who answered your phone?
I hear that he's still alive.
I will shoot.
Great minds think alike.
Koalas are cute.
Tom didn't want people to think that he was flirting with Mary.
What makes you smile?
Who's your favorite writer?
Did you see anyone run away?
How can I become rich?
I should have been watching more carefully.
It's still not ready.
Three of these are Tom's.
They eat chocolate.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
I promise you I'll help you.
I guess I was mistaken.
What is going on?
How can you be so cruel?
Tom is thirty years old.
She stabbed him.
Tom is adorable.
I have two daughters and two sons.
The new engine must undergo all the necessary tests.
I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
We're contented.
Don't kid yourself. You couldn't afford to buy a house like this.
She killed herself by taking poison.
Even at the end of the nineteenth century, sailors in the British Navy were not permitted to use knives and forks because using them was considered a sign of weakness.
The damage has been done.
We're not going.
Why are you afraid of me?
The more unique each person is, the more he contributes to the wisdom of others.
I found it easy to find the building.
The police persuaded the criminal to surrender his weapon.
I thought you did fairly well.
I'll go this way.
I love it here.
They braved the snow storm.
Do you really want to go to the party with Tom?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Everything Tom did was groundbreaking.
Is there any salt left?
He is not as tall as his brother.
Do you remember anything?
Did you go to Nikko yesterday?
My new car is red.
I thought you'd say that.
That's how I like things.
My grades have improved significantly.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
An eagle's wings are more than one meter across.
I'll always be there for you.
I'm still in town.
I saw the figure of a man.
It's difficult to peel chestnuts.
She left the room.
What's in the bag?
I'm on my lunch break.
You should go now.
Do you have any allergies?
Tom signed the documents.
Our TV is out of order.
This is for my friend.
Recently we have had several disasters.
They plan to get married tomorrow.
Is that your sister?
Don't touch the stove.
I felt left out.
I feel like going on a trip.
I eventually want to be fluent in German.
The explosion was so powerful that the roof was blown away.
You're my friends, both of you.
Life is a great mystery.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
I had to see you.
I like clocks.
We learned why the French Revolution broke out.
This book is geared towards beginners.
He was surprised to hear about the murder case.
Are you here alone?
Not everyone believed this plan was a good one.
Whoever says so is a liar.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
Tom shaved off his beard and dyed his hair blonde, hoping people wouldn't recognize him.
The thief ran away when she saw the policeman.
You need a joystick.
We drank a lot.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
We're strong.
Tom would never go there by himself.
My parents made me go there.
Can I tell you something very personal?
We finally struck a bargain.
It will heal.
Can I have your phone number?
Tom was my neighbor for three years.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
Tom filed a patent for his invention.
That was obvious.
What are you interested in?
I'd appreciate it.
You got the date wrong when you were filling in the check.
This one is ours.
That's why I'm telling you not to go alone.
Tom is probably not busy right now.
How did you manage to escape?
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
Have you finished your meal?
I waited for ten minutes.
You have only to give him a little help.
This place was bombed during the war.
It reminds me of the good old times.
He explained to me that he had no money.
Would you like to see your husband grow a beard?
I figured I could count on you.
Welcome to your new home.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I made no promises.
We saw a stranger walking outside.
She has never gone abroad.
I am completely out of breath.
Write Tom.
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
I hate it here.
I will wait outside.
How are you going to do that?
We have a lot to learn from other cultures.
I've been working here for many years.
Let's go by car.
The police were suspicious of his movements.
I want to be here with you.
I was going to write to you, but I started doing other things and forgot.
I very much don't want to have to do that.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
If only she were to help, the job would be finished sooner.
I don't need Tom.
That's a nice tie you're wearing.
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter.
Fried food usually doesn't agree with me.
Tom is my brother's friend.
This doesn't seem normal to me.
I want to visit Korea.
Don't be so impatient.
She helped her father with the work in the garden.
You won't stay, will you?
He felt himself growing old.
I can't do this by myself.
Have you ever been to Boston?
Are you sure they can do this?
I am not wearing any underwear.
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.
We're resilient.
Would you like some help?
He used to love her.
The accused told the judge that he was innocent.
Why did you help Tom escape?
I used to be like you.
I really like that guy.
There's a rumor going around that she got a new job.
I'll wait for you here.
The light turned green.
Computers are capable of doing very complicated work in a split second.
Stay positive.
Let me carry your suitcase.
Stay in this room.
Stay away from that place.
Tom never learned how to read and write.
Do you think you'll stay long?
Come down from the tree.
Isn't that what you were hoping for?
Click here for more information.
He thinks he can prove it.
Hold it with both hands.
Cows supply milk.
She devoted herself to him.
What is this for?
She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
Does that suit you?
You're the only person that can do this.
Is it possible to drink salt water?
I've found a better way.
I'm sorry, I really am.
The teacher called the students in alphabetical order.
I have to make the best of that small room.
Everyone is suffering.
I hope you had a great weekend.
I enjoy traveling.
Oil is expensive.
Could you do this instead of me?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
We're going to go into the other room.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
He returned to Japan.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
How long are they?
Tom got time and a half when he worked beyond his usual quitting time.
Can you supply me with all I need?
That's the way I like it.
We're not happy.
You think I'm scared, don't you?
We got stuck in traffic.
I dried my face.
He cannot be trusted.
My duty is to protect everyone here.
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
He went for the doctor.
I made you coffee.
It doesn't surprise me.
The meeting was all but over.
She visited her husband in prison.
She didn't telephone after all.
That apple is big.
I love Monday!
Just do it.
My flight will arrive at 2:30.
He wants to go.
The production of vegetables is growing in our area.
He did it right away.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Do you like oysters?
I think I understand the pressures you are under.
I'm just happy to be here.
Seen from the moon, the earth looks like a ball.
You know I have to go.
What time will you have breakfast?
Does it offend you?
You seem upset.
You should not go there.
We have to be careful with expenses.
Many ethnic groups traditionally give money as a wedding gift.
She explained the reason why she was late.
I leave this afternoon.
I like living with Tom.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
I always thought Tom would outlive me.
You need to lose weight.
I don't know if he is a doctor.
He was robbed of his money on the street.
They were wealthy.
He's getting old.
No one is there.
Sorry to interrupt you.
Asia is much larger than Australia.
He turned over in bed.
I hear that Mary is very pretty.
They're not going to give you this job.
He clearly stated that point.
I'd rather stay home with you.
Tom told me he wasn't planning on eating out today.
"Will you be at my party tomorrow night?" "I'll try to be there."
Give it to them.
It's just a formality.
It was not an easy decision.
Tom is a fast learner.
Complete the sentence.
You'll be crying before long.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
Can't you just leave me alone?
These objects are very useful.
Drink it down.
You're obnoxious.
"Will they go on strike again?" "I'm afraid so."
How much money does he have?
I hear someone singing.
I can see the top of the mountain.
He always puts himself first.
This is so crazy.
I only saw him once.
He was more than a king.
I know you're upset.
Open the door, please.
They do it faster than us.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
Trees do not grow on prairies.
We've endured three wars.
Tom can speak French.
How much am I paying you?
I can't help thinking my father is still alive.
I went to see a movie with Tom after school.
Tell me what that man is like.
How will you manage without a job?
We're not ready.
We can't trust anyone now.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
He got up suddenly and walked out of the room.
I felt a drop of rain on my head.
Do you want to eat this?
She is gentle.
That's easy.
The concert is over.
We hardly ever see you around here anymore.
I can't go with you.
You're doing it wrong!
What time will the washing machine repairman come?
He's not as old as my brother.
I want back what you've taken from me.
I was never told that I was supposed to be at that meeting.
I wonder what ear lobes are for.
I know exactly how it was.
Let's visit some temples tomorrow.
It seems that the store is closed today.
She has no manners.
We lost the game.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Do you know what day it is?
I'm so glad Tom won the race.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
Can you forget your native language?
Don't be shy.
First, let's talk about Tom.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
He asked for a drink of water.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
I don't mind it here.
The vote is unanimous.
You can borrow an umbrella if you need one.
I think I did well.
Turn left.
You're very clever.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
She plays the piano every day.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
I'm sure they'll be very happy together.
There is no third choice.
What do you see in him?
This is nothing.
I was just wondering if you have been able to find a place to live.
We're all busy.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
They took it by force.
She couldn't come because he was sick.
They met each other halfway.
I love playing chess.
It's in the garage.
I went to see my parents.
What does any of that have to do with me?
Just keep moving.
Tom still isn't quite convinced.
Is Tom here?
I didn't think we'd be able to get in.
Get Tom to help you.
What's our plan?
Don't let that dog come near me!
I'm terrible at math.
I am staying with my uncle for the time being, but later I will move to a small apartment.
You should know better.
We kept together for safety.
Lunch will be provided.
I always root for the underdog.
We can seat you soon.
I want to be safe.
You seem really busy this morning.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
I've given this a great deal of thought.
If we leave now, we should make it.
Tom took the ring off his finger.
Stop shouting.
I do not think that he will come.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Stay away from that.
I will give you this bicycle as a birthday present.
Tom drank too much wine.
I didn't know that until this morning.
I like it very much.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
I have no control over it.
I thought you might want to come along.
I run before breakfast every morning.
I ordered those books from Germany.
The food was great in Italy.
I don't have time for this.
Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
We are all eager to see the movie.
There are several exits.
She wouldn't even speak to him.
You've got to wake up.
I hesitated about which road to take.
What kind of person would forget to pick their children up after school?
It'll take me at least three hours to do my homework tonight.
We lived close by the sea.
He was sick, but he went to school.
Is there something in particular that you want?
Are you about done?
Where did this one come from?
I've been working on this for months.
I made my son a new suit.
Do you realize that?
I think what you say is true.
They got married three months ago.
You look amazing.
Tom is voting.
They got the short end of the stick.
What have you done to yourself?
I yelled at Tom.
I figured that you weren't coming.
Is this your book?
He is always full of ideas.
Tom almost never speaks French.
Tom always stays at school as late as the teachers allow him to.
It was supposed to be kept secret.
Is the movie theater near the station?
Tom was wearing his pajamas when he opened the door.
I hear someone singing.
It's two o'clock in the morning.
I would rather stay at home than go fishing.
Did you recognize any of those people?
I play volleyball a lot.
There is no one there.
The lawyer believed in his client's innocence.
You've got to tell Tom how you feel.
I have a lot of work to get through today.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Everything went as planned.
How is this possible?
I guess you'll need some help.
It was him that broke the window yesterday.
Do you really want Tom to do that?
We will only consent on that condition.
Won't you have some tea?
Tom used to be in a relationship with Mary.
I still believe in love.
I like being with you.
Tom doesn't have Mary's address in Boston, but he has her phone number.
He is likely to win the game.
Fighting won't settle anything.
Let me get you something to drink.
One thing you should know about me is that I'm a little overweight.
It was a judgment call.
The middle one is mine.
You need to be more careful.
Who broke this?
Today is my sister's birthday.
I'm not sure if Tom can speak French.
This is today's newspaper.
I honestly think it's better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
It was a warm summer night.
Tom looked through the binoculars.
My legs are hurting.
This medicine will soothe your headache.
I almost bought that same tie.
She was reading a gardening manual.
Tom gave Mary something.
He has been warned on several occasions.
Put it onto the table.
Not a star was to be seen.
Tom asked the teacher several questions.
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
I'm going back to Australia in October.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
What kind of deodorant do you prefer, spray or roll-on?
You can't just not do your job.
He was the sort of man you could get along with.
Tom put the sign to the wall.
I can't play tennis as well as Tom.
She came here to see me.
You need to work fast.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
You shouldn't drink this water.
He knows how to brush his teeth.
Tom doesn't like to stay at home.
English is spoken almost everywhere.
Did you start the dishwasher?
I have to make a decision.
You should do that soon.
She stood there even after the train was out of sight.
Who doesn't think so?
My father works in a factory.
Let's call it a day.
We're not really brothers.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
I play bass in a jazz band.
That kind of thing isn't important.
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
We know you're not stupid.
I don't approve of the way he bullies others.
Did you write that?
I would like to know how you will proceed in this matter.
How much money did you spend in total?
This is the calm before the storm.
He doesn't listen to me.
I've got to talk to someone.
I amused myself.
Have you betrayed me?
Pay attention on the road.
Tom could hardly speak French at all when I first met him.
It would be better if you read more books.
You're through.
I just want to help you relax.
He has dedicated his life to the preservation of nature.
I really think you should come.
Do all of you speak French?
What a disaster!
I still haven't found my keys.
How long were you there?
We may as well start at once.
How many years did Tom spend in Boston?
I was exhausted from work.
My legs hurt because I walked a lot today.
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
It's getting hard.
I wake up at 7 o'clock.
We had to call off the game because of rain.
Tom's funny.
The pressure is getting to him.
I've got lots of questions.
Why are you angry?
I ache all over.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
He called me up from Tokyo.
It's cold. Could you close the window?
You have the necessary skills.
He attempted suicide.
They deceived us.
Everyone wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.
A sensible man wouldn't say such a thing in public.
She takes piano lessons once a week.
I make it a rule not to stay up late.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
What don't you want me to do?
It was too hard.
We're all done here.
It's hard to do.
This glass isn't mine.
Give me a call tomorrow.
I went to the park yesterday.
Why are the windows open?
I walked three-fourths of a mile.
Maybe I'm going through a midlife crisis.
Don't lose heart.
Are you ready for the trip?
The job was really tough.
Paris is one of the cities I visited last year.
When he came to, he was tied to a chair in the basement.
If you get into difficulties, don't hesitate to ask for advice.
I hope it wasn't too boring.
What is the purpose of life?
I think I'm falling in love.
They love their kids.
The heat is on the administration to come up with a new policy.
You don't talk a lot.
Give it to me, please.
I know that wasn't the answer you wanted.
Where are our friends?
Come over to our table.
My teacher is a stickler for grammar.
I think you look hot.
You did a good thing.
Nobody understands you.
I want to learn how to snowboard.
He is a dreamer.
I was searching for something that didn't exist.
You may leave your bag here.
She gave it to me.
When should I return the car?
It'll take some time to shovel all the snow off the roof.
Don't do two things at a time.
The experiment ended in failure.
I saw it from the window.
That umbrella is Tom's.
I know how busy you've been.
My sister works in a bank as a secretary.
You don't want to be an editor?
His complaints never cease.
Be nice to her.
She will do her best to be here on time.
Perhaps I was wrong.
Tell me if there's anything I can do to help.
Tom never was a very good student.
I brushed my hair.
My friend remembered which way to go.
Where do you keep the booze?
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
Are you sure you're all right?
The girl has no mother.
Each of them sang a song.
Aren't you hungry?
They all scoffed.
I phoned.
Tom was the first person to arrive.
You should study harder.
Are you children all right?
The President is usually accompanied by his wife when he goes abroad.
"Have you eaten?" "Yes, I have."
You want to remain anonymous.
Farmers defaulting on loans had to auction off their land.
When will you be free?
Don't say a word to me.
He's too slow.
How about running?
We all need to work together.
How are we feeling today?
The almond trees are in bloom.
Even Japanese can make mistakes when they speak Japanese.
Do you think so?
They cultivated the land.
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
They collected shells on the beach.
My cat will love this.
I want you to tell me who gave you that.
I think it's time for me to put new bait on the hook.
I'm not sure this is necessary.
You can't have both books.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
I can't understand what you're trying to get at.
Have you ever had a narrow escape?
It was a bitter pill to swallow.
Metal contracts when cooled.
What's causing the delay?
I kind of like you.
Let's talk shop for a while.
I never should've told Tom my password.
Several cottages have been isolated by the flood water.
I really do hope we can still be friends.
I'll be a little late today.
You shouldn't see her now.
She was ready to face her fate.
There are many parks in Boston.
Luckily, we have a plan.
Have you heard from him?
What do you need?
Thank you for picking me up.
He had no friend to help him.
Did you put it somewhere?
Tom, you should see this.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
We knew something had to be done.
I'm not scared.
What if something went wrong?
You're first.
The well ran dry.
You don't even know why I'm here.
Get me something to eat.
"What kind of beer do you want?" "What do you have on tap?"
I would rather not go.
You're very attractive.
I was upstairs.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I hate these new boots.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
Tom pressed a hidden button.
Stop treating me like a child.
She scrubbed the floor of the kitchen with a brush.
I'd like to go with you.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
Just do the job.
Be careful about what you eat.
Have a beer with me.
Does the story have a happy ending?
Tom hopes to visit Boston next summer.
Have you called the boss already?
It began to rain before I got home.
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.
What is a life worth living?
I prefer to work alone.
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
It all started on a hot summer night.
How much is it going to cost me?
Maybe we should tell somebody.
We're doing well.
We'll meet in three hours.
You did your part.
We weren't all that busy.
You're so sweet.
The room is dark.
Is your school in this town?
They have been reading an interesting book.
He is here!
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
I can't tell you how many times I've been there.
I let you down.
You need to be more aggressive.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Tom is relieved.
I wish I could help you more.
Don't handle my books with dirty hands.
Tom sounds angry.
We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
Tom is right-handed.
Tom is happy to finally be at home.
Tom and Mary both complained about the weather.
Put the book on the bottom shelf.
I want to become a diplomat.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
We spent more money than was expected.
Probably he will come soon.
He repaired his watch by himself.
Are you up?
You'll need a flashlight.
Choose carefully.
This was bound to happen sooner or later.
They all went to the restaurant.
They're almost here.
Having a small flashlight in your pocket may come in handy.
The entire family lives there in a messy apartment.
My head really aches.
We looked at each other.
It's difficult to understand his ideas.
Your watch is on the desk.
It was not an accident.
I wanted to get my mind off work.
I do not trust him any longer.
Both Tom and I are teachers.
You're going to be OK.
About how much money do you need?
Are you getting paid for this?
You don't stand a chance.
He had suffered some failures.
The result of the experiment was inconclusive.
Is this pure gold?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
They meet once a week.
Where is the bottle of wine?
I've seen a lot of him recently.
It was all wrong.
We're not dating.
Is she so stupid that she believes such a thing?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Don't take it so literally.
I've always liked horror movies.
I'll bring the glasses.
Where's the rest?
I like fruit.
It has to be done.
What time will you have breakfast?
They said no.
Tom was a better cook than Mary was when they got married.
If I'm lucky, I will arrive on time.
Don't blame me.
I suggest you leave.
I can't promise you anything.
Let me pay.
Where are the suitcases?
I just got your letter yesterday.
Keep looking.
I hate pretending I'm interested.
Death is often compared to sleep.
Are you students?
Tell them what happened.
I don't agree with him at all.
Tom worked three years for me.
It hurts so much.
Can you unjam the printer?
Did you see it?
I'm glad you weren't injured.
You're very understanding.
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
The dog jumped over a chair.
I'm certain that he'll come.
Churches are designated on the map with crosses.
I ate your piece of cake.
Is that your car?
I see you are ready.
They don't know that I'm Japanese.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
They're not prepared for this.
I feed my dog twice a day.
That job gave him little gratification.
I have to work tomorrow.
We walked around the pond.
We've looked at a lot of things.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
I'm not going to eat this.
Why don't you ask him directly?
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
I'm going to teach you some karate.
I cannot help feeling that the attempt has turned out to be a failure.
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
My sister dressed herself for the party in a hurry.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
The telephone is ringing. If you want, I'll answer it.
You did that on your own, didn't you?
He failed, due to lack of money.
It sounds great!
You have only to give him a little help.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I can't stand to see animals be teased.
Don't get mad, promise.
How could something like this happen?
She is constantly writing letters.
What time is dinner?
The medicine tastes bitter.
Why are you sweating so much?
The date of the party is still up in the air.
The cat is lazy.
She took advantage of the fine weather to paint the wall.
They arrived just in time for the last train.
This is kind of fun.
I would like to see Tom once more.
I want to believe you.
Can I dial direct?
Tom likes Mary's long black hair.
We sat on a bench in the park.
Can you skip me?
He slammed his door shut.
She slipped her arm into his.
Who do you think the murderer is?
With any luck, there will be no school tomorrow.
I thought you were a friend.
Tom spends most of his spare time practicing the guitar.
The wind ripped the roof off our building.
Even his servants despised him.
You're foolish.
Twelve people have walked on the moon.
Hypnotism works.
Do you have a knife?
She's such a lovely girl!
Tom told me he was wounded.
No one knows what to say.
Do you have the time?
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Would you say they match?
I have no time to watch TV.
We're in kind of a hurry.
Turn down the radio.
Does he have a girlfriend?
You're too trusting.
Peel two of the bananas.

The clouds floating in the sky are beautiful.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
We felt good.
She looked me in the eye.
I've learned something from this book.
I hate the way I look.
One language is never enough.
Would you like to meet Tom?
My father can speak French, but my mother can't.
I didn't realize you were awake.
I don't think he has anything to do with the matter.
Let me find out.
Are you honest?
They knew exactly what they were doing.
I took over my father's job.
Why limit yourself to just one?
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
It isn't worth worrying about it.
Tom and Mary washed the dishes together.
Where did you go for spring break?
Why would I want to go there alone?
You and I have something in common.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
All was silent in the house.
We're going to do everything we can.
I study at a university.
He made a lot of money.
Maybe we should pray.
I've got a good reason not to like Tom.
I really have missed you.
I'm smarter than you.
She has a very good voice.
I'd like to talk with you.
He wouldn't even speak to me.
There's a peacock in the courtyard.
I'm sorry, but I can't go with you.
Has the train been delayed?
It's a lot of fun to be with you.
I've heard of you.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
When were you born?
I'm here as a friend.
You need to help me.
It has been over three years since I moved here.
She is capable of teaching both English and French.
I'm a little hungry.
Can you read Arabic?
You're a terrible dancer.

My father will kill me.
They're not here yet.

The virus is starting to mutate.
That is no business of yours.
This encyclopaedia is convenient for looking up things.
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
I have two sons.
Check that.
I ran into a tree.
Can we just drop it?
If it doesn't exist, create it.
Tom spent three months in the hospital.
Have a drink with me.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn.
My father runs a restaurant.

There are going to be consequences.

It's convenient to live so close to the train station.
My feet are always cold.

No one I know buys CDs anymore.
I refuse to open the door.
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.
What's the weather like?
I'm not skinny.
I said exactly what they wanted to hear.
Be careful with my luggage.
It never occurred to me that what I was doing might be illegal.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
That's how it works.
I write almost every day.
We are two of a kind.
There's no minimum wage here.
I didn't think you'd show up.
Tom wasn't his usual self today.
You don't have the guts.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Please keep it under your hat.
I hope it helps.
You can't blame him.
Try to be generous and forgive.
Spell your name, please.
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
How are you feeling today?
Someone is coming.
There's a stowaway on the ship.
He's addicted to junk food.
I have just what you need.
You're very timid.
I want you focus on the here and now.
She always says nice things about him, especially when he's around.
We met last Thursday.
That bridge is made of stone.
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
Who are we fighting?
Let's ask.
I'm not guilty.
The butcher cut up the calf's carcass.
I'm making a documentary.
I'm not surprised that Tom did that.
Please keep it a secret.
The road is straight for over ten miles.
The meeting is held twice a month.
I take it you know Tom pretty well.
I cut the article out of the magazine.
You look very dignified.
Fortunately, she didn't die.
They despise you.
That's impossible.
I've learned not to put much stock in what he says.
The wedding ceremony was performed in the morning.
None of my classmates live near here.
Do you like summer?

Let's have lunch.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
She went for a walk with him this morning.
What narrow stairs!
If it gets boring, I will go home.
In case I can't come, I'll give you a call beforehand.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
I love her so much I could die.
I don't think Tom likes to ski.
I thought I was alone here.
Tom did it with the best of intentions.
Whether the problem is important or unimportant, you must solve it.
Everyone dies.
I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
He called me up almost every day.
They live in a mansion.
They're not alone.
He will never visit the town again.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I shouldn't have gone there.
Move out of my way.
I don't have the ball.
It really is amazing.
It's all yours.
You don't need to say anything.
I never heard from him again.
We know our problems.
You must work hard to succeed.
I'll call the pharmacy.
Tom borrowed my car.
This chimney is made of brick.
I cannot feel at home in such a hotel.
Whose bicycle is this?
I understand now why he didn't go to a university.
Did you try to listen to her?
At last, they reached the top of the mountain.
Please come pick up your package at the reception.
He wants to go to America.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
I waited for Tom outside.
She turned the doorknob slowly.
You have to pay in advance.
She accepts criticism from anyone but her parents.
Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
I tried not to cry.
You like Boston, don't you?
Who does your decorating?
You're very forward.
Do not come here.
I had a nightmare last night.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
Get me up at eight.
Just tell them no.
He didn't want to talk about it further.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
I put it in your room.
Why do they want to talk to me?
Have you already read this book?
You're not allowed to eat those.
Is he a teacher?
I didn't care.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
My cat is happy.
Study hard and learn all you can.
Would you mind if I drank the rest of the milk?
I don't like classical music.
Who is it that you're working for?
He moved from place to place.
You'd better get up early.
That's not what you used to say.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
I don't know what to say.
Keep the meter running.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
You seem to be making progress.
I like astrology.
You were there, weren't you?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
How do you stand this heat?
Why did they do that?
You sound angry.
Is there a school bus?
I saw them kissing.
Tom often goes fishing.
I can't afford to pay so much.
You'd make a good counselor.
Do you really think this is worth thirty dollars?
I really didn't want to bother you again.
Tom loves Mary.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
They're self sufficient.
He has two daughters, one is a pianist and the other is a violist.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
We took strong measures to prevent it.
Every ship needs a captain.
I checked twice to make certain we hadn't made any mistakes.
He regretted having been lazy.
Explain it to me.
You look a little pale.
Does this make me look fat?
Since she got her braces, I've hardly seen her smile.
Tom told me he checked the oil level.
I was going to ask Tom to do that.
We'll figure something out.
The deadline is approaching.
I buried it.
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
I'll meet you at the bus station.
Lead is much heavier than aluminum.
Are you from here?
I'm fine.
Is there something wrong with your phone?
Everybody's in position.
I just finished reading the book.
Tom and Mary were speaking in French, so I had no idea what they were talking about.
Fill out this form, please.
I advise you wear a heavy coat.
War is hell.
I teach French at a nearby junior high school.
What else do you have?
We're starved.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
Please get all of your junk out of this room.
Are you over your cold yet?
There'll come a day when you'll regret it.
I relaxed.
I just didn't want you to worry.
How could you know?
She never stops complaining.
Nobody will notice.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
Keep an eye on it.
He was surprised at the news.
You don't seem too surprised.
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio.
That exercise is good for the abdominal muscles.
I'm going downtown.
I reconsidered your offer.
I wonder what that means.
It's very valuable.
She had to rely upon her inner strength.
Are you really a princess?
You still have a lot to learn about women.
This looks like a close-range gunshot wound.
I bought some cheese and milk.
I loved that house.
Write down your name here.
They did not clap for us.
I meant what I said.
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
Let's be honest with each other.
Tom wasn't able to talk at the meeting.
He holds the rank of colonel.
I am thankful for the food I eat.
If you heat ice, it melts.
You're my best customer.
The school year is almost over.
I just want things to be normal.
They are all very busy.
I wanted to laugh.
Is he still there?
Here she comes.
He did not sleep a wink.
When did you start wearing contacts?
Just when I was about to phone her, a letter arrived from her.
You still haven't told me how old you are.
Tom obviously didn't know about it.
You're pretty good.
They let me go.
Are you making friends here?
You must make your parents happy.
She was astonishingly beautiful.
My wife isn't doing very well.
Tom is someone who can't be trusted.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
I've done everything necessary.
If it had not been for your advice, I could not have succeeded.
Tom read the letter aloud.
Tom is better than I was at his age.
Many young people were present at the party.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
The mail train lost most of its mail in the fire.
I can't function without you.
I don't have a beard.
She held him tightly and never wanted to let go.
It happened three hours ago.
I'd like to do what you do.
What do you spend most of your time on the computer doing?
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
Let's keep this private.
The cake was crawling with ants.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Do you love each other very much?
Have you betrayed me?
She provided me with some food.
Choose whichever you like.
Tom arrived late as usual.
You will soon get to like him.
They come from the same village.
I enjoy looking at my old diary.
Tom bought an expensive Christmas present for himself.
I dislocated my shoulder.
Did something happen between you and Tom?
I didn't know you were looking for me.
Can you determine what happened?
I'd like to go home.
I think I left something in the classroom.
To tell you the truth, I'm completely bored.
There's a general sense that something should be done about unemployment.
I want to give you a gift.
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.
She always fed her children before she fed her dog.
I've borrowed a car.
I wish to speak to you.
Do we have to take the bus?
If Tom hadn't invited me, I wouldn't have come.
The robot went out of control.
Take mine.
I had a very tight schedule last week, but this week I'm relatively free.
They attempted to escape.
He married my cousin.
I know that you feel helpless.
I'd love to know if my luggage is arriving soon.
Your story is hard to believe.
I'll be thirty next week.
I was in way over my head.
How long were you gone?
There are too many people here. Let's go somewhere else.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
The door opens into the bedroom.
Your plan sounds great.
I was flat on my back for a week with a terrible cold.
I can't stand it that she's suffering so.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
I have a slight headache.
I want to talk to you about this report.
He gave some milk to the cat.
We want to see you again.
It was pitch black outside.
Tom was Mary's first love.
There was a food fight in the cafeteria.
You know enough.
It was such a boring speech that I fell asleep.
This a very significant discovery.
I like the way you treat me.
Do I look busy to you?
We're ready to put the boat in the water.
What more is there to know?
I don't like your smile.
Don't you see what's happened?
Please put the chair away. It is in the way.
I just got out of prison three months ago.
I like things just the way they are.
She got him to drive.
I hope you found everything you need.
She is very afraid of the dark.
Let's leave the matter as it is for the present.
I used to keep a diary in English when I was a student.
Did you live here before?
I bribed them.
I'll be happy to work with you.
She hardly talks at all.
Get into your car.
There was a loud explosion.
She is in a hurry because she is late.
Their answer is yes.
Do you want me to drive you to the airport?
She worked hard.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
Tom is not fond of pets.
Tom helped me with the move.
I was just talking to your mother.
Carbon dating was performed on the sample to determine its age.
I want to see what I'm up against.
We found it in the park.
Why are you at home?
I was just about to come looking for you.
Why are you so busy today?
Don't try God's patience.
That's a good excuse.
I find learning languages to be very rewarding.
To the best of my knowledge, the rumor is not true.
Let me ask you something, Tom.
We have to wait for him.
I don't deserve to live.
I think we're in trouble.
You can't have both of them.
She lives quite close by.
What are you saying?
Everyone loves his country.
He went to New York on Monday.
Is it your bike?
They were in that room with me all night.
Are you feeling sick?
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
The line is engaged.
He doesn't know what it is to be poor.
We had to stop.
You seem distracted today.
Your mother and father are dead.
I don't quite follow you.
What's the fare to Liverpool?
He's missed the boat.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
I didn't sleep all night.
It's only ten minutes' walk from here.
I'll see you in the morning.
I want to buy them all.
Where did the money go?
Keep your hands to yourself.
Do you love music?
I don't like the way he looks at you.
He would not give it up without a struggle.
Why are you ignoring me?
You must be very special.
I'm not really worried about that.
You're lost.
This is a DVD.
Germany then had a powerful army.
All we can do is wait for the police to arrive.
Could you speak as slowly as possible?
Most of the policemen lost their jobs.
School has closed for the Christmas holidays.
I think it was a mistake that you didn't take my advice.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
At present, the cause of the disease is unknown.
We wouldn't want to disappoint Tom.
I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
I'm at your disposal.
She is not wrong.
Her hobby is bodybuilding.
Please don't overdo it.
I think Tom is sad.
We're planning to spend our honeymoon abroad.
Her face beamed with joy.
This is so good.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I take vitamins.
We provided the flood victims with food and clothing.
It's not quite ready yet.
Some children do not like vegetables.
It is premature to discuss it now.
This doesn't make sense to me either.
Please write down your name.
He denied it.
Please stop playing with your hat.
A book is always an acceptable gift.
My mother doesn't know how to ride a bicycle.
I want to get on with my life.
May I have a look at your ticket?
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be singled out for a full body search.
I realize that you guys wouldn't be here if you didn't have to be.
Why don't men hibernate?
The risk is too great.
We slept in the same bed.
Look out for pedestrians when you drive a car.
Tom was killed in the explosion.
The company released a press release.
There are exceptions.
It's very similar.
He's a world-class scientist.
I gather you were hurt.
She spoke scarcely a word of English.
"Does she have a dog?" "No, she doesn't."
My brother-in-law is really egotistical.
I admire your determination.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
I had a part-time job as a hotel maid, but I didn't like it very much.
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
We competed with each other for the prize.
Would you like to know how I did that?
That gave me a rough idea.
I am saving money in order to buy a new personal computer.
I'm very sorry I lied.
I didn't see you.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I'd like to eat spaghetti.
That's what she said.
He had little experience with international issues.
She has a sense of fashion.
If you need a change of pace, why don't you come for a visit?
How many of you are there?
Can you read that?
I lent my pencil to Tom.
She wore a beautiful dress.
Help us, please.
Continue digging.
You'd better tell the truth.
We'd like separate checks.
You could've been hurt.
He attended the meeting in place of his boss.
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live.
I don't know what you're interested in.
I started that.
He's a slowpoke.
I was discouraged.
I don't like horror movies.
Do you have any idea what happened?
You must study more.
Try not to laugh.
No one is going to harm you.
Tom is supposed to do that without any help.
In case of a fire, use the stairs.
Tom didn't bring his keys.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
How much time and energy do you spend on projects that don't make you any money?
If anyone can do that, it's Tom.
Is this a joke?
Tom didn't have the courage to disobey Mary.
We study Arabic.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
I told you to call me.
They'll be ready for that.
It brings me great joy.
Close the door after you.
Let's get the party started.
I'm not telling you.
I thought it was the least I could do.
He came by bus.
You nearly died.
You knew the answer all along.
Luck is blind.
He used to live here.
Do you have your plane ticket?
You're very curious.
Tom never liked school.
Who did you go with?
Is Tom safe?
Our class has forty-five students.
What do you mean by it?
Why are you so happy?
It's really hot there.
Opportunities like this don't come along every day.
Shopping malls are popular among teenagers.
It's unlike him to get so angry.
I didn't read it all.
Don't change your mind so often.
How could you not give me the message?
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
He has a rich imagination.
I let them go.
He lives in his car.
He is crazy about skiing.
She has never visited him.
I know what they are thinking.
I don't know why I bother with you.
When I was your age, I was already married.
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
I'll do that for Tom.
This kind of thing usually takes a long time.
Tom doesn't want to wait any longer.
I was glad to hear of your success.
I'm not counting.
We'll need a head hunting agency to find the right man for this executive position.
I'm not planning anything.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
Everyone liked Tom.
Put another log on the fire.
What did Tom do today?
"Will you have another slice of pie?" "Yes, please."
We will soon be having snow.
Don't worry.
Life has just begun.
History repeats itself.
You're fired.
When did you fire Tom?
I finally feel like everything's going my way.
It seems that the rainy season is finally over.
You're foolish.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
That's a sign.
Please give me the book.
Who's your mother-in-law?
He was accused of stealing money.
He worked far into the night.
Nobody called Tom.
It's a cloudy day.
Why do you always do this?
So what happened to you anyway?
He has been waiting for an hour.
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
They hold me responsible for it.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Reading books will make you smarter.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
Will you show me your album?
I did have fun.
I know what can happen here.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
Don't trust what he says.
Is there any reason not to go?
I saw you snickering.
I love being a teacher.
Will you sell me your house?
That's ludicrous.
They want a few more hours to finish the report.
Would Tom agree to this?
You seem a little nervous.
Make a sketch of your house.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I wanted Tom to see the sunrise.
He did it out of kindness.
Thank you for all you did for me that time.
Don't you get it?
I was dumbfounded.
My sister showers every morning.
Tom thought it was a terrible idea.
Tom knew where Mary was, but he wouldn't tell the police where she was.
You said it yourself.
I can give it a try.
She says she will call you later.
We elected him to be mayor.
I thought it would be a good idea.
Don't be afraid.
What's the reason?
He's a construction worker.
My cousin is hooked on smack.
I have often heard it said that honesty is the best policy.
It's warm today so you can swim in the sea.
I didn't know Tom came from Boston.
You can't just walk away from this mess.
I turned off my phone.
Do you want some wine?
This doesn't involve you.
Did you shut the door?
Tom said he had to help Mary.
I heard the front door slam.
I'll play with you.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Am I interrupting anything?
Just give me what I want.
That's what I thought you said.
That man died of lung cancer a week ago.
He was delighted at the result.
It's already done.
It's impossible to take on more work at the moment.
He denied knowing anything about their plans.
Hands up! This is a robbery.
Will this satisfy you?
There is no wind today.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
That attack killed thirteen people.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river.
You're the master.
Tom has a dog named Cookie.
She urged him to consider the request.
I'll put the eggs in the refrigerator.
I have been here since five o'clock.
You're putting words in my mouth.
She owns many valuable works.
How long have you been in Australia?
We demanded that she should make up for the loss.
Just a few days ago, we were so happy.
My hands are stained with paint.
Supplies were no problem.
I'm not available.
That's a strange question.
She was deceived by a friend.
Did you stop at the red light?
I don't have that much time left.
I don't believe we've met.
Can I have one of these?
Well, let's have a look.
Is it far?
I like the original better than the remix.
You're very skeptical.
How was the universe created?
Hey, what are you two up to?
Can you tell us about it?
Call off your dogs.
It'll come in handy.
He came here to help me.
You're adorable.
I remember when it happened.
I hope that's good enough.
We received an immediate answer to our letter.
Tom also speaks French.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
What do you see in him?
Terrific!
I think Tom wants Mary's job.
What if he's wrong?
Tom knows he's partly to blame.
That dog is big.
The leaders were out of touch with the people.
You have visitors.
Tom didn't give up.
I'm pleased to see you.
It's all mine.
That's your half.
We all have secrets.
You have such beautiful, hazel eyes.
It's time you went to the barber's.
What is happening?
I'm very excited and happy.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need help.
You don't seem very satisfied.
I am buying candy and cookies.
My taxi should be here soon.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
Let's wait a while.
Tom will be surprised to see you.
Tom understands what you don't.
I find this disgusting.
I want to be left alone.
I just want you to listen.
Tom has an iPhone.
Where did you take these photos?
Tom is patient, isn't he?
We can't just sit around and do nothing.
What are you talking about?
There isn't enough cake for everybody.
It could be better.
Tell me that was a joke!
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
Can you validate this parking ticket?
Be a good girl.
Tom became very ill.
Are you happy?
I don't see what's wrong with that.
I'm stuck in Boston.
He is taking a walk.
There's something in the box.
You should not give your children everything they want.
He bit his lip.
He failed the entrance exam.
The game has been postponed indefinitely.
Bartender, I'd like to have a drink.
Are you in danger?
I have many talents.
Tom knows Mary is hiding something.
You have no right to be here.
I can teach you something.
I saw him crossing the street.
He's the captain of a team.
I got hot.
Tom can count on Mary.
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Just remember to have fun.
I had him paint the gate last week.
What is your type exactly?
Please call him up.
I have hay fever.
Why did you quit?
I appreciate what you did earlier.
I hope they appreciate it.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
He became a famous singer.
It was extremely weird.
He needed capital to start a new business.
I never should've gotten divorced.
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
Tom is special.
Have you told Tom you're here?
Put it on my account.
Disconnect the power cable from the modem, wait for approximately one minute, then reconnect the cable.
Don't be so outraged.
Did anyone see you there?
Evening was drawing near.
She has no one to turn to.
Tom is an optometrist.
You must not make noises in the classroom.
How do you stop this?
I am in trouble.
He jumped from one subject to another.
What should I do to save time?
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
You don't have permission to do that.
That's all we saw.
Is that a trick question?
I can swim as well as you.
I have read every book in the library.
Have you thought about what we talked about the other night?
You need to follow me.
You should go see a dentist.
The children made sculptures out of wire.
I haven't told anybody else.
We were both drunk.
Why would I want to sue you?
He rarely goes to the movies.
Which is it going to be?
A dog that barks all the time doesn't make a good watch dog.
I can drop you off at the airport tonight.
Must I write in ink?
Because his parents had died when he was young, his uncle brought him up.
Tom is respected by everybody.
The cat loves playing in the garden.
I was very proud of that.
Nobody forced you to help me.
I've made a first draft of my thesis.
Why did you come here?
That sounds reasonable.
I wish I could sing like Tom.
No one seems to know what this is used for.
She advised him against doing it.
My primary concern is your safety.
Tom is vulgar.
Sometimes trying your best just isn't good enough.
I got off lightly.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Get out of this car.
He studied interior decoration.
What's in the file?
You're no saint.
How's it going?
Tom's room wasn't clean.
Please refrain from smoking here.
I feel it now.
I want the truth from you.
I didn't know that you needed to do that.
Tom spends a lot of time on the beach.
It seems like the cat caught the scent of a mouse.
Call me if you have any problems.
A fire broke out on the second floor.
I went twice.
I hope we didn't wake you.
The path was narrow.
The wall is covered with graffiti.
Tom is your age.
You can't do that.
She showed her album to me.
Butter is made from cream.
What foods should a diabetic not eat?
This is my umbrella.
Reading improves the mind.
This tastes good.
At first, everything seemed difficult.
Tom didn't sign the agreement.
Cheese doesn't digest easily.
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
It's one of mine.
I've made up my mind.
You look really good.
I'd like to join a night bus tour.
We're out of ammunition.
He's a freshman.
Tom pushed the raft into the water.
You have two balls.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
I hiccup a lot.
Don't talk back to me like that.
Some of them are teachers.
I was at home all day yesterday.
I've been here all afternoon.
How about tonight?
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
I want you to be quiet.
I had to abstain from smoking while I was in the hospital.
They'll take me away.
I heard someone come into the room.
She walks.
I'll go back.
I'm afraid of the dark.
Thanks for the cup of coffee.
I'd like to earn my keep while I'm staying with you.
How do you plan to help me?
She advised him to talk about his life in America.
I don't want you at my party.
The park is open to everybody.
When do you usually get off work?
Beer bottles are made of glass.
Our lives changed.
That's only part of it.
You have to live with it.
She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
I need this more than you.
You're the first person I told that to.
I'm tired of doing this.
We got ready.
I met him on my way from school.
Do you like to study?
Can I get either of you a drink?
She told me an interesting story.
There's not much difference.
Which floor do you live on?
Was it difficult to make?
Things are looking great.
I feel more confident now.
This winter is warm.
This is getting out of hand.
Tom and Mary are talking about what they'll do on Valentine's Day.
Is death the only way out?
It's old and clunky.
You did a bad job.
Tom and Mary were frightened.
I went twice.
I think you did an excellent job.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
This is what he said.
I'm surprised they didn't have anything to do.
Researchers say that it's easier to lose weight if you eat three square meals a day.
Are you listening to me?
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
I remembered it.
Improved medical technology has been one of the spin-offs of the space program.
It will be some time before he gets well.
He was walking in front of me.
Do you like to be kept waiting?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Have you ever been run over?
Please give me that book.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
We should do our best.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
It's not illegal.
I like math best.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
I want to show you something very special.
We're not going to be able to call you.
They defused the bomb before it could blow up.
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
This is the boy.
Would you like me to order it?
I like your hat.
Where can I buy silk?
Look after Tom.
I want back what you've taken from me.
We looked for her.
I can't be killed so easily.
I'm fairly happy.
Guess what I found on the beach.
Is it a yes or a no?
Was that too hard?
You're very wise.
Why aren't you listening to me?
Are you lying to me?
I can't remember where this little doodad goes.
I love you people.
I hope you find it interesting.
They gathered at the coffee shop for a meeting.
Would you please not leave the door open?
Don't read in this room.
Wake up, Tom.
Tom is a biochemist.
He is tall and strong.
I know it's a lie.
I wish to live in a big city.
I was born in Kyoto in 1980.
Is he afraid of death?
Take all the time you want.
What flower do you like best?
He thought that he would write something for the newspaper.
He arrived at the station at seven.
Tom was in love.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
I fail to understand his true aim.
Don't get yourself killed.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
Let's take the short cut.
I tried to make the best of it.
I can't figure out how to register a new domain name.
He came back at nine o'clock.
I'm not offended.
Speaking of hobbies, I'm fond of baseball.
The baby was shaking the rattle.
I'll tell you anything you want to know.
You're very rude.
Step forward.
Did you see Tom at school today?
I really appreciate you picking me up.
This bike is easy to ride.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
You sure are pretty.
I have so many clothes I don't know what to wear tomorrow.
Take a look at these.
Take a walk every day.
Could you please tell me again why you are late?
What did they hit you with?
Let's get divorced.
It's for you to decide.
It was impossible to understand his questions.
Tom's mother must've been very disappointed.
This is a waterproof watch.
I'll show you that you're wrong.
They don't despise you.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than me.
What kind of funeral do you want?
That shouldn't be much of a problem.
Do you have psychic powers?
You'll have to stand on your toes to see.
Tom told me that he couldn't really trust Microsoft.
You lost an earring.
I got acquainted with her in France.
You don't know how much I wanted to do that.
Where did you put the book I was reading?
He is living apart from his wife.
If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand.
I looked in the window.
We're always careful.
He made me a cake.
I appreciate your situation.
We'll be making an announcement shortly.
Bring me today's paper.
Tom may have missed the bus.
He took pity on me and helped me out.
He couldn't hold back his tears.
Did you have any luck?
I didn't want to postpone our meeting.
You're the one who trained me.
I didn't think of the consequences.
That didn't work.
I'd love to sing for you.
I have plenty of time.
You don't seem too worried.
I worked hard.
A dog is barking.
They're really tight.
I want you to let me go.
Anyone home?
This shoe fits me well.
I never want to feel like this again.
We can't attend.
You'd be perfect for that.
His speech was not altogether bad.
The radio doesn't work.
There's no denying the harmful effects of smoking.
She forgot to write him.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
He is a pioneer in this field.
Tom has already gone to bed.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
I wonder when they'll come out with a cell phone in a wrist watch.
What does this sign mean?
Do you want to go to a soccer game?
The plane is approaching New York.
No one ate the cake.
Logic is obviously your strong point.
Breakfast is served.
We're not looking.
I'm not mentally prepared for that.
I have a bus ticket.
How about running?
There is some wind.
We're careful.
I forgot my jacket.
Drinks are on me.
I don't want to hear any more of your complaining.
I play golf every chance I get.
This book was new.
The word has several meanings.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
I'm completely exhausted.
Developing political awareness takes time.
He made me out to be a liar.
What do you say we go skiing?
Don't trust anybody.
I have many model cars.
She cooks for him every day.
He always treats me like a child.
Who will win?
He left a while ago.
What foods, if any, do you avoid eating?
Tom asked me who my father was.
I'm not lonely.
I did write to him.
He is terrible at speaking English.
Don't ask me to help you ever again.
Tom could have told me the truth.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
I gave you fair warning.
The queen visited the museum.
The snow was several meters deep.
I want to name the baby after you.
Could you check the tire pressure?
Don't push me.
Did you forget something?
Do you have any others?
Tom looks happier today.
Have you told your parents?
I didn't look at my feet.
I was stung by a bee.
I can't live without you.
Please wait here.
I should be happy.
I want you to be my friend again.
I think you were right.
Tom always makes me laugh.
You don't have to obey such a law.
Are you happy right now?
I still can't afford to do that.
They tapped the terrorists' phone lines.
Please don't waste water.
I had to climb over the fence.
She looked him right in the eyes.
He had plenty of money for his trip.
I know what your name is.
Are you sure this is the right train?
You're not good at this.
Tom is a member of the SWAT team.
Mary asked her family for a loan.
Who's the woman with the red hat?
Where is the admission's office?
I don't understand a thing you're saying.
There is something you must know.
I want to have something to remember you by.
Tom almost always laughs at his own jokes.
The class went wild.
You'll have to pay double.
What a terrible mistake!
Every day my dad leaves for work at eight o'clock.
Where did you park the car?
The curtain rose.
I don't gossip.
You're wonderful.
He was writing a letter while listening to music.
You really should enter the contest.
There's no need to hurry.
When was the last time we met?
Stay out of the rain.
I love looking at everyone's colorful kimonos on Coming of Age Day.
Your speech will be recorded in history.
I'll live.
Will you check the tires?
I don't think that's enough.
The doctor examined the baby.
Do you think that's significant?
Tom was unreliable.
She is an efficient and reliable assistant.
We need to find a new babysitter.
A museum is a great place to find a date.
I can't invite all my friends at once.
Someone ate all the cookies.
I usually toss my loose change into my desk drawer.
She felt her heart beating fast.
It is certain that he will come here.
Who can tell what will happen in the future?
Anything you say may be used against you.
She is convinced of my innocence.
If you eat at this time of night, you'll get fat.
There's no one here.
She loves him now more than she did before.
I'm pleased with my new jacket.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
When did you start studying Latin?
It is becoming warmer day by day.
I beg you to help me.
I will look it up in the dictionary.
They look healthy.
Someone took my place.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
They're cleaning the beach.
I doubt if it'll snow.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
Did I have a choice?
Whose binoculars are these?
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
Find out where Tom is.
May God bless you.
I feel giddy.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
That's what makes this so difficult.
I forgot to ask your name.
What time is it?
There was nobody there.
I'm trustworthy.
If you hadn't done it, someone else would have.
You're off the hook.
We're looking for somebody who can speak French.
You understand, right?
I presented my ticket at the door.
We all want Tom to be happy.
I don't know if I can do this.
He ripped his shirt open.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
I suggested that we bring the meeting to an end.
Why don't you ever cook?
Let me ask you a few questions.
His new movie is disappointing.
I should have talked to you first about it.
Are all these books yours?
Some were farmers, some were hunters.
Tom teaches French.
I never drink alone.
I was surprised by what I learned.
He would often sit for hours without doing anything.
There's a huge mark up on imported electronic goods.
I'm your new lawyer.
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
I only wish that were possible.
I want to enjoy it.
How did you spend your vacation?
It was a fine day and there were no clouds in the sky.
How much are you being paid to do this?
He used to smoke, but now he doesn't.
I can't breathe through my nose.
Violence will not be tolerated.
I can't tell you what an honor this is.
Could I use your phone?
Tom kept digging.
He looked at her from head to foot.
He won't be home at lunch time.
Take what you need.
We don't have to do this.
Can you hold on a little longer?
Hollywood marriages rarely last.
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
Leave the room as it is.
This camera is the one that Tom bought last Thursday.
Can I have a word with you?
Try to open the door.
Isn't it scary?
How many pictures has Tom taken?
I'm really not very good at French.
Do you smoke?
How do you account for that?
They will have to cut down their expenses.
That's not what I'm afraid of.
There's nothing good on television.
I'm a married woman.
Don't wait.
My father isn't home.
Do you still play the piano?
I spent the day with Tom.
It sounds like someone is crying.
I think we all should have been more careful.
Tom doesn't have a job.
I've always liked you.
Tom sent a text message to Mary.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
Nothing happens by chance.
Please tell me what you saw then.
Who was this picture painted by?
You deserve so much more than this.
He said hello to the woman.
Let's ask the teacher.
Car production in that year reached a record 10 million vehicles.
Please open it.
Her friend is a singer.
I love the beaches in Australia.
You're not dying.
You don't want to keep him waiting.
She is older and wiser now.
Everybody saw it.
Tom told me you were in Boston.
After decades of civil war, order was restored.
She came back before eight.
Say it in English.
Tom is the person who helped Mary.
I'd like to hear you sing.
I think we need those.
I miss her a lot.
Five gallons of regular, please.
He is an acrobat.
I'd like some shoes.
Doctors take an oath not to harm anyone.
Tom told us everything.
I'd rather clean my room than spend time doing my homework.
Tom doesn't want to discourage Mary.
It's not possible to live on that island.
He is by far the best baseball player at our school.
They saw us as they were getting off the train.
I always keep my promises.
Go away. I'm busy.
Do you have any travelers' checks?
This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous.
She got me a tiny toy.
I managed to catch the last train.
It rained all day.
My grandmother used to use her sewing machine a lot when she was younger.
She wanted to live a more relaxing life.
She went there to swim.
I'm sorry Tom isn't here.
Both dogs are asleep.
"May I help you?" "No, thank you. I'm just looking."
Write your address here.
I could hear everything.
He didn't carry out his promise.
I agree with what Tom said.
He asked me what I needed.
That's only the tip of the iceberg.
There's really no reason for you to go to Boston.
My opinion is the same as yours.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
I know Tom is psyched.
Tom is listening now.
It's not natural for a mother to outlive her child.
Let's see what happens.
We saw the child get on the bus.
I think I'd like to marry her.
One of the apples fell to the ground.
This policy is sure to go a long way towards stimulating business.
Why not wait until tomorrow?
Let's play baseball.
I'm sick of your complaints.
Don't confuse comets and asteroids.
You're the experts.
He went out a few minutes ago.
Tom caught a fish.
We're saved.
I'm not sure when he'll turn up.
This is the end.
I've got to see a dentist.
Why are you alone?
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
I figured out a way to make more money.
It is impossible for me to do so.
Whenever I hear that song, I think of a certain girl.
I know Tom is groggy.
She rented a four-room apartment.
The job is half done.
A wise man would not act in that way.
The refrigerator door was open.
Tom is at school.
You look a little shaken.
We have an agreement.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
I did not mean to disappoint her.
Is this your bicycle?
You idiot!
Do you think Tom saw us?
A glass of water will make you feel better.
I get a call from her once in a while.
I figured I could count on you.
I'm not gambling anymore.
He lost himself quickly in the crowd.
He is a daydreamer.
Aren't we lucky?
I'm impressed you've done so well.
I'm sorry for my terrible French. I'm still a beginner.
He brought me back in his car.
I have to do it again.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
You'll be thirty years old next year.
You don't have to tell me this.
I want that more than I've ever wanted anything in my life.
It isn't worthwhile going there.
We're not killers.
Tom is a student, isn't he?
You look happy today.
Isn't that romantic?
I don't know if you remember me, but we met a couple of years ago in Boston.
She has about 2,000 books.
He was left all alone in the woods.
Where did you have your suit made?
Tom can't stop Mary from doing that.
It's been a while since I've eaten anything with mustard.
That's what I've always said.
How about I do that?
We're the problem.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
I really wish you would do that.
Why don't you sing for us?
Who would look after my children if I died?
Tom has traveled around Australia.
He is the best player on our team.
This is going to get messy.
The party's on Monday.
We must achieve our aim at any price.
I did everything for you.
What did you get hit with?
That was completely unacceptable.
Why would someone do that?
It seems to be working.
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
I wonder if Tom lied to us about that.
He's a man you can rely on.
You're very brave.
How's your new job?
Warm this morning, isn't it?
Here, have a drink.
She felt her knees tremble.
He overslept this morning.
I beg to differ with you.
How many boys are there in your class?
I'd heard you'd changed.
Was I polite enough?
Tom got there long after we did.
That's what I thought.
You're not helping.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
The doctor wants Tom to lose a little weight.
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
Feel this.
Tom has canceled his trip.
It could just be your imagination.
We weren't happy.
We listened to the bell ring.
Tom will take care of this.
We didn't intend to attack him.
He earns his living by playing the piano.
I got caught.
They would like to stay at home.
I've always wanted to be a father.
Is this seat vacant?
Would you like me to repeat the question?
Who do you live with?
It's a matter of principle.
I have a daughter in high school.
You worry too much about Tom.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I just want your love.
The truth is that the parents were to blame.
It was very painful.
My sister and I went to the castle.
I almost forgot that it was his birthday.
Weird things are happening.
We're inside.
You don't have to worry.
Can't you move faster?
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
Tom thinks Mary is in Boston, but she's actually in Chicago now.
I didn't see it.
She suddenly fell silent.
I have no hair on my head.
I'm ready now, Tom.
He called me a cab.
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
You have to memorize this sentence.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.
Tom has a sister.
You're not allowed in there.
They canceled.
I didn't save the file.
I always have room for dessert.
Don't beat yourself up.
You probably just want to be alone.
Bears can climb trees.
I loved you.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees in here.
I didn't think it was important.
I have already started my vacation.
They were scolded by the teacher.
I am not concerned with this affair.
I thought you'd be more helpful.
I applied for membership in the association.
Can I talk to you alone for a second?
The weather was gorgeous.
Tom wondered whether it would be hard to find a job in Boston.
Tom doesn't have to wait.
Go and wake Tom up.
When did you start writing songs?
She came back just as I was leaving.
I just want to make it up to you.
You shouldn't be drinking on an empty stomach.
Tom kissed Mary's forehead.
It appears that you are all mistaken.
I'm proud of you guys.
He gets his hair cut once a month.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
I'm spending my holiday on the beach.
My older sister is good at typing.
I hope I can count on your discretion.
I resent that implication.
Space travel was thought to be impossible.
They forgot to wake me up.
Did you hear that what's-his-face crashed his motorcycle?
How many times did you see the movie?
It's suicidal.
How can we be sure of his honesty?
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
Could you turn it down?
How long will it take us to get to Boston?
The goods arrived yesterday.
Would you like some more tea?
I went outside early in the morning.
Tom usually comes on time.
I wish it was as simple as that.
She is always complaining of her small salary.
It rained nonstop.
It was white.
Look around.
She works for French intelligence.
How dare you talk to my son like that!
I wouldn't change a thing.
Tom is chopping wood.
Someone stole my stuff.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon.
Is this all of them?
You'd make a good counselor.
You can trust him to keep his word.
I would never do it again.
She listened to music for hours.
She ended up getting married to him.
That's a tower.
I figured that would make you laugh.
Wake up.
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him?
I just can't wait to go to work.
He called off the trip.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Tom eats twice as much as Mary.
I had to do my duty.
The fence needed painting.
Take the wheel.
I have a few dollars.
She is great at skiing.
They're not so bad.
I asked my father to buy this toy.
You're not finished.
I fell when I was running.
Tom's younger daughter is married.
I was not pleased.
I will not attend the party.
My car, which broke down yesterday, has not been repaired yet.
I can imagine how you felt.
No one heard anything.
They laughed.
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
Tom heard some shots.
Tom and Mary are still young.
Write it down before you forget it.
We’ve been waiting for hours.
I don't know your name.
We've got enough.
We should learn from those who have gone before us.
Actions speak louder than words.
They agreed to meet me here.
They refused to help us.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
It's pretty hot.
We're planning a party.
Is this seat empty?
You need a job.
I'm not good enough for you.
Please open the bottle.
Please leave.
What does it involve?
Motivation is the key to success.
Wait for me in the car.
I've got a few friends.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
He felt himself seized by a strong arm from behind.
Tom has forgotten how to do it.
That's all we can ask.
He's stronger than me.
She is much taller than me.
There is no connection between them.
Keep children away from the pond.
This road goes to the park.
I'm willing to apologize.
They got the short end of the stick.
How long is the Nile River?
I don't know why you're all so angry.
Stay in the house.
Remove your hat.
Have you confirmed it?
We did not move for fear we should wake him up.
I'm getting married in October.
We have something very important that we have to discuss.
I know you're hiding something.
Don't you know how beautiful you are?
I was quite shocked by this.
He looks pale.
Can I use a credit card?
They found it.
We had to react quickly.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
I'm just a normal guy.
There are many possible explanations.
He left his parents when he was eight years old.
How much does it cost?
Is the mouse dead or alive?
You should quit smoking.
We've been unable to determine the cause.
Something very weird happened to me yesterday.
I want them alive.
We cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
Don't make me do this.
Are you free for lunch?
You don't want to lose that.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
They kept drinking.
That was such good a book that I read it three times.
You can't be happy all the time.
Take your time. There's no rush.
Why were you laughing?
Please do something about it.
They told me I had to help you.
This typewriter doesn't work.
Would you like to switch seats?
No one left.
We have a holiday today.
It's easy to remember.
You have mail.
He is not kind to her.
I thought it was funny.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
He's kind of cute.
Tom comes from Boston.
We don't have to read that.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
Is she all right?
We were up all night talking.
What would you like to eat?
You're unfair.
It's important that you tell the truth.
I put on my trousers.
We all agreed.
We went to the beach to swim.
Will you exchange this sweater for a larger one?
Some people compare life to a stage.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
My heart wasn't in the work.
My mother made me a bag.
I have read three Shakespearian works up to now.
He isn't actually the manager.
Did you leave at the same time as my younger sister?
I love trying to do new things.
I only hope it is not too late.
She went to the museum by taxi.
Tom lives in a house on the edge of the village.
Tell me what we're doing here.
I hope to marry her.
I've loved you since I first met you.
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
I will follow you wherever you go.
He deals in used cars.
I just need you to trust me, OK?
You should have done so.
Have you had lunch?
Are you lonely?
We're all a bit a scared.
Get me another lawyer.
I can't stand it any longer.
My uncle lived to be ninety.
Tell me about it!
Man is the only animal that can use fire.
The clock stopped.
I rested in the shade of a tree.
How to meet future energy demand is a big question we must consider.
We can't work under these conditions.
He is a physicist.
Should we have some lunch?
I'm planning to move to Boston.
Is there still any sugar?
Where's the pan lid?
He studied hard.
You're not the only woman here.
I bet you didn't know that.
Tom died when he was 97.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
I don't want to go to work.
The tape recorder was on the table.
Give my regards to your aunt and uncle.
Do you like your coworkers?
You can stay with us for the night.
Man has the gift of speech.
Don't forget to see me tomorrow morning.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I felt very uneasy.
Could we go faster? I'm late.
She is very busy.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
May I see your driver's license, sir?
If that happens, call me.
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
What do you do in your free time?
She nodded in response to my question.
Who am I to second guess him?
He cheated me.
Tom is vulgar.
Everyone was asleep.
Where did you have your new suit made?
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
You say I should know him quite well, but as a matter of fact, I was introduced to him only last week.
You're not that old, Tom.
I need a red pen.
She helped her daughter get dressed.
You're ambitious.
We need to get out of here.
Tom is more famous than I am.
I lost no time in doing it.
She can never keep a secret.
There's a car coming.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection.
The children broke the ancient urn.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Why does ice float?
I'm very tired.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Once is not enough.
What's happening?
How many did you take?
I need to get some air.
What time is your curfew?
I usually get up at eight.
He gets a reasonable salary as a bank clerk.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
Tom called back.
We don't have class on Wednesday afternoons.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
Mt. Aso is an active volcano.
Stop!
He finally met my demands.
My mother looks young for her age.
I couldn't stop laughing.
He can't tell right from wrong.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
I want to buy them all.
They went surfing.
I'd like to eat curry rice for dinner.
The cause of the fire is not known.
I can't stand it here any longer. I need a change of scenery.
When you have a question, ask the teacher.
I must hurry.
She gave him a sweater.
She advised him to catch the first train in the morning.
Did they talk to each other?
Thank you for sending me a nice card.
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.
Do you feel like having a drink?
There is no wind today.
Tom says he can't ignore Mary's behavior any longer.
I'll call you at seven.
He is tired from overwork.
You can't leave me now.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
We need your support.
Did it really take three hours to do that?
Tom, I'm happy for you.
I can't believe he kissed you.
They couldn't help us.
It's all right. I can wait.
Don't rub it in.
That's what I need to do.
No one believed me.
This picture must have been taken in 1964.
That's alright.
He will love her forever.
I'm not discouraged.
My father is getting better and better.
A friend of mine came to see me during the day.
Try to remain calm.
I like bananas more than apples.
He's always on time for his appointments.
You can't just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant.
Do you have any other questions?
I'd like to book three seats.
The door opened and a man walked in.
He can play tennis very well.
The North won the Battle of Shiloh.
It pays to be polite.
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
The problem is not settled yet.
You were useless.
I had the exact same feeling.
Tom asked Mary to read the letter.
Would you like something smaller?
I don't know what to do.
I think you're in danger.
He's three years older than I am.
The people are friendly here.
I thought Tom was at school.
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
Tom threw away all the old newspapers that were in the attic.
I wouldn't want to lose my job.
I'm hardworking.
We were all wondering why you were late.
That time table gives the hours of arrival and departure.
I have to be there at 2:30.
You don't need luck.
She's no singer.
I hear some screaming.
Tom works with Mary.
He was wrong.
I'm the one who built this.
How many students are there in total?
Why are you worried?
Everybody's in bed.
I think Tom would like that.
He continued walking for a while.
He is my close friend.
I can't remember his name.
What's got into you?
I just got there as fast as I could.
On the rocks, please.
You can use mine.
No one is asking you.
Has Tom been fired?
I love the sun.
I suppose you've already applied for a visa.
That makes me happy.
I am ready to die.
We do everything together.
Tom knows everybody.
Nobody's going to rescue you.
She isn't kind to him.
She advised him not to drink too much.
Do you like tennis?
I wonder whose car this is.
I've been looking foward to meeting you.
I liked your friends.
I heard the song sung in French.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
I don't like the atmosphere of that school.
Tom is just curious.
I should've known this.
What have you come up with?
I cooked supper last night.
You're a filthy liar!
They believe in God.
Let's go ahead and eat.
Long hair is out of fashion now.
I don't know anything about what happened.
The boys are thirsty.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
Tom is the boy I told you about the other day.
Get on your horse.
He was absent from school.
I've already drunk half a bottle of wine while I was waiting for you.
I was tricked into doing it.
We made out like bandits.
I have cancer.
Do you think there's a connection?
You are the chosen one.
Keep on smiling.
He didn't get caught.
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
He will make a good team captain.
Did you call me last night?
I don't see what else we can do.
Life is short.
The apricot trees are in full blossom.
Our new method of doing that is quicker and more efficient.
I had hoped you might say that.
My mother gets up early.
My husband's going to kill me.
What's your native language?
You don't know the truth.
I forgot my medications.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
I want a piece of candy.
My brother is a freshman.
That's the limit.
I'd like to finish the job.
I don't care how much you want it. I'm not going to give it to you.
I've forgotten my email address.
How have you been recently?
Don't try to keep her to yourself.
She tied up the parcel with string.
He took out his handkerchief.
Come back later.
I was tired.
I want to hear everything.
How long did you stay at the party?
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
I am surprised to learn this.
Haven't you ever kissed a girl?
I love the songs sung by Kylie Minogue.
The rain made me late.
He expressed himself very well in English.
Now I'm used to it.
He picked up a red stone.
The monthly staff meeting is never held on Monday.
I'm sick of this game.
What do you advise me to do?
I know I heard something.
How is your family?
Tom is always very friendly.
I asked Tom why he wanted to study French.
He is a man of wisdom.
What did I tell you?
He has nothing to complain about.
Cows eat grass.
Consider the following scenario.
I had hoped that my mother would live until I got married.
Both spellings are correct.
"What's happening in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
I read the book from cover to cover.
Leave my house.
I'm too tired to drive. Could you drive?
Don't open the door till the train stops.
I feel as if I were dreaming.
I've been accused of murder.
Who yelled?
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
What makes you think Tom can do this?
There is no factory in this village.
I hate moving.
I will go if you go.
I love teaching.
My mother is constantly forgetting people's names.
It's going really well.
What do you think of this plan?
He told me an interesting story.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
People often complain about the weather.
We all make mistakes, right?
Enjoy it while you can.
Are you doctors?
How did they get in here?
I thought you'd never get here.
I learned about Greek culture.
He acts very shy in her presence.
The desk is made of wood.
Did you get my gift?
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
Anything is OK with me.
It is kind of you to give me a ride.
He worked very hard.
There are a lot of people in the waiting room.
I ran out of gas.
Every man has his price.
She's so gullible she'll believe anything you tell her.
I came with my friends.
The smoke blew away.
Tom already has our respect.
I stopped smoking and drinking.
I'm smarter than you.
He had decided on a new policy.
I don't mean to challenge your theory.
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom is surprisingly strong.
Would you be so kind as to open the door for me?
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
I haven't read either of his novels.
We ate some apples.
What happened? The car's slowing down.
It's just a little further.
I would have written a longer letter if I'd had more time.
I wish I'd made better use of my time.
They're now alone.
I want a room with two beds.
The moon circles the earth.
I told you so.
I'll text you the address.
You'll catch the bus if you hurry.
I've upset you.
I'd like to give this to somebody we can trust.
Nowadays it is not unusual for a woman to travel alone.
Her book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
You look perfect.
What's your best price?
You're just the person I want to speak to.
He doesn't like being told what to do.
Tom is a lot smarter than you think he is.
That made Tom pretty mad.
You only have to ask for it.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
Tom's lunch includes a sandwich and an apple.
Write in the date yourself.
We're friends now.
My alarm didn't go off this morning.
I want to be at home.
I think we need more coffee.
As soon as I can afford it, I plan to travel around the world.
You're not very funny.
He looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I remember my mother teaching me the alphabet.
I own a horse.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
At last, you've hit the nail on the head!
Can you spare me a few minutes? I'd like to have a word with you.
She asked him to marry her.
He's a very hard worker.
We should've gotten up earlier.
She is living abroad.
These are questions worth discussing.
Let me help you put on your coat.
He weighs a lot more than before.
He offered no specific explanation for his strange behavior.
I told them everything.
We don't want anyone asking questions.
Are you quite certain about it?
He went back to the store.
I must calculate how much money I'll spend next week.
I'm very sad to hear that.
Give her a doll.
I can't control myself.
Can you pass me the potatoes?
We regard him as our hero.
I've always loved you.
I've been asked to give this to you.
They finished building the bridge on time.
I want to sit down for a change.
She has very good manners.
What scared you?
How was your meeting?
I apologize to all of you.
I remember seeing him.
You're the best.
What other reason could there be?
You can't control me.
I had a quarrel with him over money.
One cannot embrace the unembraceable.
Could you put these in a box?
I'll do your homework for you.
I always knew you were a nice guy.
You'll understand it right away.
I grew up in a poor family.
Your friendship is important.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Hippopotamuses love water.
I've never done harm to anyone.
I don't like Tom so much.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
Go with Tom.
Those were his actual words.
It rained for a week.
He showed me how to make a cake.
I have no interest whatsoever in eating English food.
I'd like to give you something.
The conference went on according to plan.
I enjoy your company.
Tom found a job as a mechanic.
I think we could be great friends.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I reminded him of his interview with the president.
Watch us.
I'm only going to say this once.
He came to Japan two years ago.
If you look around, you'll see many people doing the same thing.
Few people live on the island.
When did you go to work?
There is nothing to cancel.
Tom is waiting for you.
It often snows here.
You're no doctor.
At this time, there's no safer place to be than right here.
Does she still have a temperature?
I was captured.
I can come.
I guess it's OK.
I'm the only one who understands.
Today, too, the temperature is below zero.
The doors were closed.
Are you sure it was Tom?
We haven't had time to do that yet.
These fields produce fine crops.
You're losing.
It failed.
You're lucky that you have a job.
I like pizza very much.
You were such a big help yesterday.
She's supposed to be back by lunch time.
We are not to be disturbed.
Thank you, my dear.
We went to the beach together.
Goodnight, Mother.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to pay that bill today.
No one else was injured.
It is no exaggeration to call him a genius.
We want to protect this world we have.
Are you sure you're up for it?
That guy's a friend of mine.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
Get out while you can.
Have you tried Japanese beer?
I might be drunk, but I'm not crazy.
What are you all doing here?
Give me five days.
My grandfather loves to read.
How many letters are there in the English alphabet?
I wish that I could give you the money you need.
Tom knew that he'd been tricked.
My watch is different from yours.
The water stopped running because the hose has a kink in it.
We're back.
I really don't understand why you think that's a good idea.
This textbook is written in simple English.
You're running a big risk in trusting him.
He said he wasn't used to speaking in public.
What do we do now?
I think we should use our time a bit more constructively.
The stable is right behind the farm house.
I can do this all night.
Tom refused to sign his name.
You've brightened my day.
I don't know how many minutes we've got.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's taking us way too much time to get this job finished.
Since he didn't know what to say, he remained silent.
I like listening to music.
Japanese children are group members even when they are sleeping.
You can't trust anything he says.
To tell the truth, I didn't notice it.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
She took advantage of my ignorance.
I like rice.
She promised not to go out alone.
You're the one who trained me.
I've paid parking fines a number of times myself.
I'll tell you all I know about it.
When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands.
Why are you so secretive?
My glasses started to slip down my nose.
I don't like this anymore.
Tom is very tired, and he's hungry.
Try to avoid junk food.
The door blew shut.
I'll do anything you wish.
He didn't pass after all.
To put it briefly, she turned down his proposal.
When did that happen?
Can you promise me that?
Have we met before?
Tom wanted me to learn French.
Here. Take this with you. It might come in handy.
At last, her dream to be a doctor came true.
Why doesn't Tom help you?
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
I hate when other people make me wait a long time.
I give up. No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied.
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
Tom has a loose tooth.
I went for a long walk.
Take care.
Everyone has their own strong and weak points.
Tom said he had a lot of money.
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
Tom hid under the table.
Tom doesn't believe it.
That's really great.
It sounds simple.
It was heartless of him to say such a thing to the sick man.
You should've told me yesterday.
You've come too early.
Do you like Wagner?
Do you belong to any clubs?
Tom trusts Mary.
In this town, there is only one train station.
Most, if not all, people enjoy eating.
I need support.
We haven't seen you in a while.
We have waited more than a week for your response.
Will there be any food at the party?
I need my key.
It doesn't matter to me whether she comes here or not.
Tom spilled the milk.
Stop playing hard to get.
He OD'd on cocaine.
She committed suicide by taking poison.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
I borrowed money not only from Tom, but from his wife, too.
You'd better tell him the truth.
It was a beautiful wedding.
I won't say it again.
You're not in a hurry, are you?
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
We're not young.
He has guts.
I've had enough.
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
The light in Tom's room is on.
You can have it for nothing.
My driver's license will expire next week.
He doesn't look happy to see us.
Is it an elk?
This is your house now.
Our ultimate goal is to establish world peace.
A team of paramedics is standing by.
Everything's under control.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
There are some cookies under the table.
I leave this afternoon.
Tom lived in Boston for a long time.
I don't have a good feeling about this.
I don't feel like doing it.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
It was hard.
Tom hesitated.
Where's the nearest shopping mall?
To tell the truth, I didn't notice it.
It's a nice town.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
I think Tom has gone away.
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
What did it turn out to be?
Have you ever tried it?
You have got to be kidding me.
I would rather stay here.
They all watched.
He turned out to be nothing but a liar.
Let the weekend begin.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
I know very little about him.
There's no evidence.
His office is very close to mine.
She gets good marks in English.
Nobody knows the future.
The dog seems to have been sick.
We'll have to separate the wires.
It's not a weapon.
You don't have to wait until the end.
They want you to resign.
Tom behaved badly.
We can't do that yet.
He can speak a little English.
I don't even know who he is.
He took off his clothes.
There's a lot of wind this morning, isn't there?
I've decided never to vote again.
Tom looked a bit surprised.
Tom doesn't look like a rebel.
He was transported to a local hospital.
I've never seen something like this.
I got up early, so that I could catch the first train.
How do they seem to you?
A girl phoned me.
Tell me all the details.
It's true that Americans love pizza.
You will regret this.
Please help me get a taxi.
Everyone should know this.
Tom passed away last year.
Let me explain the rules.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Tom's boat was stolen.
You're fashionable.
Tom said that Mary was alone.
We're not perfect.
I see what you mean.
Don't worry. I'll do it.
I will quit smoking for good.
Did you see Tom at school today?
Tom pretended to be Canadian.
That's worth remembering.
What in the world is that?
I like that.
Never mind, I can do it by myself.
Did you turn the stove off?
You said it was important.
Every time it rains, the roof leaks.
I must adjust my watch. It's slow.
This must be for you.
I will come tomorrow without fail.
I want to talk now.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
He knows a lot about flowers.
Will you take me there?
I didn't know you were unhappy.
I've lost patience with Tom.
She said she was happy.
I got married three years ago.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
Can we have a moment alone?
I cannot fix the computer.
It's five o'clock somewhere now.
I was shaken.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
Do you know how to do this?
It's your bedtime.
He came home very late.
She baked me a cake.
Turn down the music.
Keep quiet.
My car is a Toyota.
Don't be late for school.
I will get it for you.
There's no class today.
She must have told a lie.
Most experts think a lot of his theory.
I don't feel like sitting down.
This is the book I want to buy.
That young lady is a nurse.
When I was young, I used to climb trees a lot.
I hope to see you again.
That didn't help.
The introduction of foreign plants and animals can cause severe damage to ecosystems.
You're out of sugar.
I'm not at all interested in physics.
I'll work alone.
He is roasting coffee beans.
Do you think you can manage to keep things going until I get back?
I think you panicked.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
I don't like being treated like this.
Which cap is yours?
Tom says he doesn't know where Mary bought her pearl necklace.
Tom shouldn't trust Mary.
Tom has lived alone since his wife died.
I need to talk to you about this.
You've been busy, haven't you?
That's not very original.
I could see Tokyo Tower far away.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
I'm saying no.
I knew there was a reason.
Just at that time, the bus stopped.
I lost my key.
What keeps you going?
Red is better.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
He pretended not to hear me.
Tom is worried sick about Mary.
The girls fainted.
That's not my name.
We're not getting married.
We're managing.
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
Put yourself in my place.
He repaired his watch by himself.
Tom isn't wearing a red tie.
If I screw up, what's the worst that can happen?
He's a hunk.
He turned pale with fright.
Why don't you run for student council?
Nobody likes rats.
All of us were excited with the result of the experiment.
I intend to go to the barbershop.
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
He had dinner by himself.
Do you have a timetable?
I didn't think anyone was home.
Why aren't you talking to me?
There are many new programs to watch this spring.
Not everything is about you.
They won't help us.
Dogs can swim.
I think you've done enough.
We all deserve respect.
I had to go back home.
I want to be worthy of your friendship.
Can I come in?
Since you're tired, you should rest.
Tom's well.
I'll feed the dog.
My house faces to the south.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Are they all strong?
They greeted me.
One month after he had become ill, he died.
Take mine.
There's so much I want to show you.
I'd recommend not doing that.
I'd like you to drive.
I am sure of his winning the speech contest.
I have never seen anyone like him.
The girl let the bird go.
You have made many mistakes.
This is residential property.
Tom decided to take a chance.
Thanks very much.
I have a throbbing pain here.
Have you begun studying English?
Are you going to save us?
You speak French a lot better than me.
It's possible, isn't it?
He was elected mayor of the city.
I've been thinking about you.
I don't have your wit.
I want time.
May we accompany you on your walk?
Do circuses still have freak shows?
I have a sister and a brother.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
Tom didn't offer me anything to drink.
Would you like to sing?
Why do you want to go to Boston?
Just leave it.
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.
I'm not going to try to do that today.
Where were you yesterday afternoon?
Tom was sick in bed last Sunday.
I'm glad you decided to come.
The rent is far too high.
You're a wonderful guy.
Money is the root of all evil.
Tom told the children many stories.
Are you having any difficulty doing that?
I know how difficult this is for you.
Tom sent Mary a lot of letters.
It's the cops!
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Eat your vegetables.
They arrived in England a week ago.
Our teacher likes his new car.
Give it to whoever needs it.
Are you still upset about what happened?
He took a book from the bookshelf.
He managed to pass the examination.
Do you have any foreign stamps?
Did it ever occur to you that I might be busy this afternoon?
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
That's what they told me.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
I'll never forget.
She married him at the age of 20.

I brush my teeth after eating.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
I want you out of here.

I made a deposit in the bank yesterday.
There may be a problem with Tom.
I fell off the chair.
He showed me how to make a cake.
It's not necessary for us to do that.
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me?
You came at just the right time.
It's getting darker and darker.
Tom can't help himself.
Stand aside.
By the way, how many kids are going?
Who did you meet there?
This doesn't fit.
Do you understand what's going on?
He is a good swimmer.
That's so depressing.

I like wild flowers.
When did you find out?

That was great advice.

Please try again.
Take whichever one you like.
We may not win tomorrow.

I found the money.

He was late for the 7:30 bus.
It was such a pleasant day that we went for a walk.
I can teach you how to sing.
He did the best he could.
Nobody has ever done that.
Tom is from Boston.
Tom kissed his cousin.
Let's discuss the matter right now.
My father has just returned from abroad.
Grab hold of this.
I had to get everyone's attention.
I don't feel like watching TV.
That's embarrassing.
You need to be more patient.
I apologize for my rudeness.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
You can still see the ship.
It is likely to rain today.
Selling cars is my job.
I want to ask you about the money you found.
The birds were flying in a group.
Tom didn't call.
I've made a couple of friends here.
Shouldn't you be studying?
I'm just looking, thank you.
He doesn't look himself this morning.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
The mother occasionally reread her son's letter.
Grow up a little.
Can you at least try?
Tom tried to run away.
I lost my wallet on the way to school.
What's wrong with that?
We wanted you.
I went inside.
Why were you fired?
Tom can drive a car.
I don't like any of them.
We need to get you to a hospital.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
Do you have any cash?
Tom began to laugh.
I didn't like the result.
I bought the novel on which the film is based.
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later.
Sometimes you can't tell.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
They tried to cheer me up.
I like skiing.
It's an interesting argument.
He went blind.
Is it a compliment?
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
I know what it's like to be the new guy.
Meet me in the hot tub.
I don't know how else to say it.
Keep your hands above the table.
I need a crew.
I thought that I saw a ghost.
We can't open this yet.
I'm coming over to your place.
He loses his temper easily.
I think that I'm just exhausted.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Is there no other way?
Do you think that dress suits her?
This must be for you.
That's a risk you have to take.
They agreed on everything.
I gave my sister a pearl necklace on her birthday.
Was it hard for you to find my house?
Were you busy last week?
The number of people who go abroad has been increasing.
I've never trusted you and I never will.
I thought I had a day off.
It looks like we're almost out of the woods.
You probably don't remember me.
Let's take a break for coffee.
Tom's prediction was accurate.
Keep going straight.
I have to comb my hair.
The boy made a paper plane.
Would you like some sugar in your tea?
Here's my phone number.
How do you know you can trust Tom?
We never speak French at home.
How old are your kids?
You're very generous.
It's almost six o'clock.
I think it's going to rain.
The police still have no leads.
You're the only one who understands me.
His wife opened the door for him.
I have run short of money.
I hate politics.
I hate winter.
It's as easy as that.
You're disloyal.

I don't know what else we can do.
I haven't seen that in a long time.
She took care of his wound.
I never get sick of dancing.
Tom has fewer friends than I do.
Don't believe this.
I never had a girlfriend before.
What're you saying?
I'm happy that you were able to find a job so quickly.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Instead of cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
May I look at the menu?
I will keep your advice in mind.
I'm not getting involved.
"Is his story true?" "I'm afraid not."
I don't want to hear that word.
Have you told me everything?
People have a tendency to underestimate their future needs.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
You can't do two things at once.
I saw Yoshida for the first time in five years.
My father is retiring next spring.
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.

I think that's wise.
Tell me where she lives.
I'll stay here till you get back.
Where do babies come from?
I'd like to know the rest of the story.
When is it going to happen?
We must do it again.
The mail can't be delivered.
You said you wanted the truth.
He was in the shower.
She went shopping.
Which horse did you bet on?
Please stop singing that song.
I'm not familiar with French poets.
They have no natural predators.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
Both Tom and I have the flu.
I appreciate the courtesy.
I'll be gone until Sunday.
We didn't plan this.
Whatever you do, don't open that door.
Tom called me almost every day while he was in Boston.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
As we went around the corner, the lake came into view.
Don't give up the fight.
I've got everything I want.
I know someone who speaks French well.
Are they displayed all through the year?
My mother teaches flower arranging.
The police used a battering ram to break down the door.
Tom is having lunch.
I'm double-parked. Could you hurry it up?
She was advised by him to go to the police.
Tie your shoes.
I can't remember how to use this machine.
Are those for me?
She attacked him with a pair of scissors.
I think that we should try again.
You were my friend.
When did you decide not to go into the office?
That was really important.
The house has icicles on it.
She managed to keep up appearances.
How long does it take to get to Boston?
They plan to have a party.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I can't afford this one either.
Yesterday, I bought a book.
I was almost right.
I'm really proud of those guys.
I'll get the check.
I'd like you to read this book.
I do not feel like doing it.
Let's not wait for the others.
The concert has already started.
If Tom needs help, we can give it to him.
Come on, let's do it.
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
They're dangerous.
They arrived just in time for the last train.
I hate this place.
You've lost a little weight, haven't you?
I don't know what it is.
She argued with him about money.
I suggested that we go fishing.
Let me introduce you to my family.
I can't really remember.
Tom is plotting something.
You dropped your handkerchief.
The house by the lake is mine.
You have to make the crease very straight.
Let me tell you about our special.
We'll have a lot of fun.
Let's be best friends forever.
Anyone else want to give it a try?
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
I got so wasted last night.
Tom prepared for the worst.
Happy New Year!
He was a rugby player.
They know what happened.
They took a big risk.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
She can speak French.
Your friends are downstairs.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
What happened to him?
You don't want to be an editor?
His autobiography was released today and was sold out by noon.
Tom is writing a letter to Mary.
How do you know where I live?
Do you like writing?
I didn't realize you were serious.
What would you like to do today?
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
You're starting to warm up now.
We relaxed in the living room.
He is old enough to drink.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Why aren't we doing that?
Do you enjoy talking?
Why did you try to run away?
Once again, I was able to escape death.
Someone stole my bag.
Tom wanted Mary to sign his yearbook.
Please tell me. I really want to hear it.
He is regretful that he couldn't go.
Would you care to bet?
You do like living dangerously.
She took a pen out of her pocket.
What's the catch?
We want to be fair.
They can't do this.
Is she all right?
Tom returned the book to the library.
He looks very worried.
I heard someone calling my name.
Be as specific as possible.
This hotel is better than the other one.
That's expensive.
We went skiing in Canada.
It was not an accident.
I get up early.
I have a brother.
I'm surprised Tom remembers us.
Tom is a good teacher, isn't he?
Hold on a minute.
Are you enjoying the play?
I can't be seen with you.
What's your speciality?
You can't tell anyone about this.
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
Don't brake suddenly.
I'm Tom's French teacher.
I can't lend this book to you.
That was ours.
Tom has a dentist appointment.
I outrank you.
Tom didn't love Mary as much as she loved him.
All the members were not present at the meeting yesterday.
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.
Normally this would be funny.
I'm sick of lying.
Didn't you feel like going?
I told you I hated that shirt.
Every time I look at this picture, I think of my father.
I can get you out of prison.
When I was growing up, I never imagined that I would become famous.
We are Arabs.
She went with him to the movies.
Please get out of my way.
She lives in Kyoto.
I'm now unarmed.
I had to work last weekend.
Don't get mad, promise.
I want to write this down.
I never would've shot you.
The ice is very thick.
I'm accustomed to working hard.
It's because I love you.
Is that going to happen soon?
Come to see me at any time tomorrow afternoon.
The news made her happy.
I'm not like that.
I want to ask you a question.
The snow melted away when spring came.
It's too late for me.
He gives me the creeps.
Is it time you need?
Can I set a place at the table for you?
They ironed out their differences.
She lay on a sofa with her eyes closed.
She hit him with a hammer.
Tom has no intention of doing that.
He asked for money.
I tend to catch colds.
This is the best ship I've ever been on.
He painted a picture of a dog.
Please let me off in front of that building.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
Just put it there.
He made no effort to apologize.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Your garden needs some attention.
Spare me the details.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Would you mind if we put this off until tomorrow?
I'm stunned.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary was.
You can't give up.
He seldom orders anything new.
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
I've finished watering the flowers.
They made sure nobody could see them.
We just want to have fun.
She has twice as many books as he has.
Be sure to come at 3.
I want you to give each other a hug.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
I love music, particularly classical.
The door was already open.
What is your number?
Ask Tom to help you.
Time cures all things.
You're very clever.
He lives here all alone.
Are you going to sing here?
You can borrow my pen.
Jet planes fly much faster than propeller planes.
Maybe we should come back later.
I'd rather stay home than go out in this weather.
I still think Tom is hiding something.
Are you still living with your parents?
It's a bit flimsy.
Don't you think most Japanese students work hard?
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
What caused the war?
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
They looked at the photo taken of me when I was a boy and laughed.
I keep a rabbit as a pet.
All my friends are invited here.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
It rained a lot last summer.
Don't worry about such a silly thing.
That book is very old.
I think watching people playing chess isn't much fun.
I can't believe you just did that.
Is your daughter here?
What did Tom put into the bag?
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
You must do this alone.
Do you know about that?
Shall we go and eat?
His work is not up to standard.
Smoking is prohibited.
Do you have a cheaper room?
You were afraid, weren't you?
I don't believe in group therapy.
She accidentally tore the page.
They joined forces and fought the enemy.
How many spoonfuls of sugar do you usually put in your tea?
Inflation is getting out of control.
How many did you get?
Coffee keeps me awake.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
War's not pretty.
I wake up at six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
I love this sweater.
Well done! You have drawn this picture nicely.
I am going to bed.
He hid behind the tree.
Let me go alone.
She lent me her bicycle.
My feet are cold.
She participates in many school activities.
She gave him something cold to drink.
Don't try to be a hero.
Her anxiety was apparent to everyone.
I'm tired of Boston.
Which dog is yours?
I get up early in the morning.
Can I write it that way?
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus.
Your telephone's ringing, Tom.
He ignored me.
The girls are excited.
The bicycle by the door is mine.
He promised to marry her.
They won't risk doing that.
We all stood up at once.
Tom doesn't know how strong you are.
That strong light blinds me.
I'm not too convinced.
You must not behave like this.
Tom made some scrambled eggs.
"What time is it now?" "It's ten o'clock."
Can't you speak English?
I was more than a little embarrassed.
I'm scheduled to have lunch with him.
Context is important.
She decided not to go.
That has allowed the creation of 4.000 new jobs.
I think he won't come.
I want to know who sent you.
What's all that for?
As is often the case with her, she was late for the meeting this afternoon.
I had no intention of going there by myself.
She looked at me and laughed.
I don't like homework.
I like talking to people.
You want something from me, don't you?
Why don't you help?
I won't say it again.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
That's not the way I see it.
She made up her mind to graduate from high school.
I don't feel like eating sushi.
I'd like to go abroad one day.
He was drunk on beer.
I know it's kind of late, but would you mind if I came over now? I have something I need to discuss with you.
What do you know about this place?
I'm really angry about this.
The contract expires next year.
I'm frantic.
Did you write this book?
Will you read this cookbook?
When will I get to Tokyo?
Why are you asking these questions?
Tom ate quickly.
I didn't hear you come in.
The teacher pokes his nose into everything.
Where is the nearest police station?
Don't you see what you're doing?
You can't run away from this.
Accidents will happen when they are least expected.
All of us stared at her.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
I don't want to fight you.
It is life that teaches us, not school.
I almost always do that in the afternoon.
Just do your best.
Since my mother was sick, I looked after her.
I'm a changed man.
This is the end of my story.
I don't have time for a vacation this year.
That's the last straw!
Please let me know if you have any questions.
I think it's time for you to grow up.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Thanks for your explanation.
You should get your eyes examined.
This telephone doesn't work.
Tom was wondering how he was supposed to get around without a car.
The murderer confessed his crime.
They didn't see anything.
They are bored.
They collected shells on the beach.
Life is crazy.
How do you know who I am?
Save Tom.
My car ran out of gas.
They made fun of Mary.
Something must have happened to him on the way.
That's the last thing I remember.
The joke was at my expense.
I'm shorter than you.
You're the teacher.
Too many sweets make you fat.
Do you want to ask me some questions?
I want to speak to your manager.
He was eager for news.
I'm fed up with homework.
What was he doing here?
The mayor is not available now.
I have a date on Friday.
What were you hoping to see?
Attendance is compulsory for all members.
Tom and Mary danced all evening.
We must leave here at once.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I can't believe you bought this.
If you want this marriage to work, you need to choose between spending time with me and working all the time.
I had a bad day today.
I wish you had come with us.
Everyone loves him.
Please make my bed.
I hope your wish will come true.
I have to look after this cat.
She is knitting a sweater.
She has long hair.
Do it right now.
I gave you what you asked for.
I feel like I'm a teenager again.
I do not remember any of it.
We want to be the best.
It's not new.
She didn't like living in the city.
You're fun.
Tom doesn't seem busy.
Where were they going?
That's not a bad thing.
I'm not very organized.
It's been weeks since she's written.
Come here, all of you.
I want the fan.
I don't want us to get caught.
I live in an apartment.
Who did you learn it from?
He is the chosen one.
She takes after her father.
I don't know if we want to do that.
We are men.
I need you to take in the hem by about an inch.
You're never at home.
I found my car missing.
There's been a change of plans.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
You're ruthless.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
He doesn't have his medication.
Will you introduce me to her?
We avoid talking about politics.
The students like it.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
I teach geography.
I knew they were your friends.
I had a good time during the trip.
We heard the boy playing the violin.
Do you like this color?
What's in the file?
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
They despise you.
Put on your shoes. Let's go out for dinner.
We'll find a way to use it.
You can't go alone.
My mother put thirteen candles on my birthday cake.
I'm not in good shape now.
You're the only Canadian I know.
Your problems don't concern me.
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
I showed him my room.
I can't believe I listened to you.
Do you agree with this?
I love my yellow sweater.
You're very sophisticated.
I know what to expect.
I hid it somewhere.
Why do you need change?
I destroyed everything.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
This year has been a lucky one for him.
Currently, he's our best batter.
They're up to no good.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
Tom has been teaching me how to play the guitar.
That can't be good for you.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Can you really not swim?
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
She's starting to annoy me.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
They are the ones who want to go.
I don't really recall.
We must go now.
I am not like you.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
I feel like I've been cheated.
I think this must be the place where Tom lives.
We painted the walls white.
I don't like hot places.
Follow him.
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
I am a bachelor.
I think you must be mistaken.
She put on socks.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
Let's not do the work.
The mailman emptied the mailbox.
What's all this stuff?
No one's listening.
They used truth serum.
Her belief in God is very firm.
We want you to take it.
The weather is getting worse.
This is your final warning.
I'm almost there.
The worst thing you can do is to only do something half seriously.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
You're very rude.
I think love doesn't exist.
I think Tom is going to die.
You're talkative.
You must do this alone.
Are you listening to the radio?
As I was reading, I became more interested.
It's just a phone.
He was banished to an island for high treason.
He knows how to make a radio.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I don't need a boyfriend.
Don't people tell you you look like Audrey Hepburn?
That was harder than I thought it would be.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Be punctual.
The chance is gone.
She had a basket full of apples.
That's possible.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
I was happy for him.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
Am I interrupting something?
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
Were you the one who rung the bell?
I think of you all the time.
I do not feel sad.
She knew the teen.
I was watching TV then.
I don't think that's appropriate.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
We trust him.
I hear you.
What would you do in my place?
That one's all yours.
It can't wait until tomorrow.
I think Tom is still sleeping.
She is poor, but she is happy.
He has enough money.
The investment advice we used to give just doesn't apply anymore.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
We have good news.
She accused me of making a mistake.
I have to go back to the office.
I'm doing my homework.
One box is still missing.
Is this wine from Argentina?
What was she like?
Tom is Mary's fiancé.
You must not touch the paintings.
She was wearing a strange hat.
I need your cooperation.
She was shocked when she heard his story.
I was mentally and physically tired.
Is this your child?
She advised him to come back at once.
Tom didn't know where Mary wanted to spend her summer vacation.
My printer is low on ink.
Don't throw stones.
He wants vengeance.
She was never disrespectful to me.
Don't go too far into the woods.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
This didn't cost anything.
Bring me the phone, Tom.
Don't try to be a hero.
They were lucky.
We could all be dead tomorrow.
Telegraph us when you get to Boston.
This is where I draw the line.
My car won't start.
Her friends waited for her by the gate.
I have to put the baby to bed.
I can't follow you.
That will be all for today.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
No one will believe us.
He pulled my shirt.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Be sensible.
Nice seeing you!
Have you heard of me?
I strongly urge you to follow my advice.
You have no idea.
If anyone can do it, you can.
Young men such as you are needed for this work.
It takes 165 years for Neptune to orbit around the sun.
He forgot his promise to go there.
He often comes late to school.
Fruit tends to rot right away.
She sued him.
I'm absolutely certain of it.
Do you know who that person is?
Would you mind if I went home early?
I really miss you.
I think we're going to need more time.
You can rely upon him.
Is there a problem with this?
How long ago did the bus leave?
Please put your cigarette out.
Are you here to spy on me?
The hiker has reached the top of the mountain.
Why do you want such an old car?
He sells whisky.
I take my hat off to you.
She cut the apple in half.
I wanted to have a beer with you.
There's no exit.
I am American.
You're demented.
Tom says that he's never tried eating dog food.
I know you did that.
She is buying books in the bookstore.
I need to borrow your pen.
I don't believe it.
Please sign on the dotted line.
I asked Tom if I could use his computer.
I burned them.
Do you think that Tom would enjoy doing that with us?
Shouldn't you be in school?
I can scarcely sleep at night.
I'm motivated.
Don't forget the ticket.
I forgive you.
Why don't you ask him directly?
Did you watch TV yesterday?
I'm just getting back to basics.
In case of an emergency, push this button.
Be watchful.
I will go with you if necessary.
There must be some misunderstanding between us.
I need an escort.
Mary's husband abused her.
What an idiot I was to lend her money.
If it is fine tomorrow, we will play baseball.
Tell me which one to choose.
I'd like to sit here for a moment.
Leave it.
I admit that I was wrong.
We ought to obey the law.
Don't blame me.
Take care of the kids.
I can't kiss you now.
His debts amount to 100,000 yen.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
I approve of your plan.
He looked up the word in his dictionary.
He can't explain what happened.
I must have it shortened.
I don't think he'll come.
What's this thing?
I was really young when I met you.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I am acquainted with the author.
I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
Because of the poor harvest, wheat prices have gone up in the last six months.
Is he American?
I love hanging out with you.
He's in Tokyo.
You don't know that.
Stop changing the subject.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
I'm sick of you.
Are you speaking to me?
Do what you want.
I checked the list.
It is difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
His office is convenient to the station.
Are you doing anything special this evening?
How did you kill the guards?
Is that your professional opinion?
How did you get interested in art?
Remain seated, please.
Tom suddenly stopped talking.
They spent the entire day on the beach.
I wouldn't want anyone to read my diary.
I wrote a letter last night.
I think Tom loves Mary.
The policeman was confronted by the angry mob.
Could I have a pillow and blanket?
I will return.
I want you to consider this.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
Kissing Tom was a mistake.
He is a recognized authority on the subject.
I wish I could go with you today.
There has to be a first time for everything.
How much are the lilies?
This is mind blowing.
He was unaware of the danger.
It's not just about the money.
Are you good at tennis?
The pain she suffered while being tortured was unimaginable.
Write with your left hand.
Do you know where she is?
No one really cares.
I remember you.
Am I being accused of murder?

The workmen arrived early, bringing their ladders.
It's not polite to point at others.
You must be in good physical condition.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I've been shopping all day.
They demanded that the mayor should resign.
I probably shouldn't have eaten that.
You're the one who trained me.
Please show me another one.
If time permits, I'll visit the museum.
We're in love.
Control yourself!
It is difficult to shoot a bird flying in the air.
Let me tell you a story.
I can't stand it anymore.
I have dandruff.
Tom can't have gone very far.
Somebody is eating.
Tell me what you saw.
Tom has been talking on the phone for an hour.
I feel like I could cry.
This telephone is out of order.
That hadn't occurred to me.
That is sold at hardware stores.
I don't like powdered sugar.
You don't talk to me that way.
She held him by the sleeve.
He is like a father to me.
It is no good to you.
She treated his broken leg.
Tom asked us to sit down.
He took my umbrella without bothering to ask.
How was your trip to Boston?
He always comes here at this time.
I never imagined he'd do that to me.
We're relaxed.
What kind of beer do you have?
In spite of the bad weather, they decided to go by car.
I'll be ready next time.
The offer is too good to turn down.
My sister made me a beautiful doll.
We found it in the park.
Go away.
Which of the composers do you like best?
Is there enough food for everyone?
Let us know if you're available next week.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
I go to school on foot.
A map is available upon request.
Tom isn't Mary's husband.
She's getting breakfast ready.
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
I hope you two are happy.
Tom understands the risks.
I can't believe I just said that.
I'm ashamed.
Who turned off the light?
Tom is watching the news.
They said he was still weak from a recent sickness.
I'm sick and tired of all this bickering.
That's her.
You are welcome to do anything you like.
How did you get interested in art?
They were swimming.
You must be very busy these days.
They have access to the library.
Women usually live longer than men.
In case of an emergency, what number should I call?

Thank you for the link.
How did you come by this painting?
I messed up.
Please tell us what it is.
Don't be so lazy.
Are you good at cooking?
Your necklace is beautiful.
Are you doing all right?
Please smile.
I sensed immediately that something was wrong.
I'd like to stay here a little longer.
I'm in the same boat as you.
Can you make it on time?
You're not helping much.
We're powerless.
She grows many kinds of flowers.
He was killed in an airplane accident.
She was looking forward to going sailing with him.
I never forgot you.
There are many tourists in town.
Let's take the bus.
You're not bleeding.
Salt was a rare and costly commodity in ancient times.
Why do you spend so much time watching TV?
Accidents happen all the time.
I gave way to their demands.
I need subtitles.
We sometimes judge others based on their actions.
I appreciate that.
I have to finish what I started.
I didn't try to kill anybody.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
We all knew about it.
My natural hair colour is blond.
Please put out your cigarettes before entering the museum.
I daydreamed all day.
He thinks only of making money.
I know that Tom can't understand French.
I love camels.
What's your favorite candy?
The storm developed into a typhoon.
Who else is with you?
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
Tom got home later than usual today.
My shoulder hurts.
Is this your bike?
Tom jumped off the diving board.
They did a good job.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Did you know that?
I have a feeling you and I have a lot in common.
My TV is broken.
Anyone can do it if they try.
Are you studying?
Did you turn off the gas?
I've made lots of friends.
The library is on the 4th floor.
He's a DJ.
I knew you wouldn't help us.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Your life is in danger.
He slept in the car.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Did you tell Tom he could go see Mary tonight?
That can be a problem.
Do you know how they knew?
Stay together.
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
I don't feel much like laughing.
I'd love to dance with you.
Tom didn't know what to believe.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
I thought you did fairly well.
Never trust a naked woman.
You must stop him.
Are you on dope?
I didn't realize you could speak French.
Tom's important.
As a matter of fact, he was convinced.
I'm disappointed in you.
You won't be disappointed.
What do you say to my plan?
I'm not like you.
Roll up your right sleeve.
Do you want us to try prying this door open?
Are we alone in the universe?
I know you have a girlfriend.
Just give me a chance.
You were scared, weren't you?
Why didn't you call me last night?
I want to go over a few things with you.
We are worried about you.
When did I say that?
It is very hard to live up to your reputation.
I've been bitten a few times.
It's all happening so fast.
She stood close to her husband.
That was quick.
I'll teach you how to sing.
My wife is going out of town for a few days.
The thieves divvied up the stolen loot among themselves.
I am not romantic at all.
Could you go to the store and grab some eggs?
You're in danger, Tom.
It was in 1950 that he was born.
We're taking over.
The girl made off with her employer's money.
She was on verge of fainting.
I was trying to reach you.
We just have to be patient.
Don't you find it interesting?
It's a dreary place.
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
It's warmer.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
I want to know the truth.
You will survive.
I want to go.
I tried to escape.
How high can you jump?
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
I want to do something for Tom.
I'm happy to have you here, Tom.
I just can't believe they're getting married.
It turned out not to be so easy to live with him.
The drowning man shouted for help.
You're the only one for me now.
His life is in my hands.
What have I done with my keys?
I'm motivated.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Tom drinks.
Tom doesn't think anybody else wants to come.
I can't force you to do anything.
Ask anybody.
If you could go back in time, what would you change?
I know the truth.
Tom said he needed to take a nap.
I have a headache and I am suffering from a cough.
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
There are no roses without thorns.
We listen to music.
Actually, you're right.
How long will we have to wait?
Don't forget to call your mom.
We live in Boston.
I'm not scared of women.
She is just a wallflower.
I think we are in agreement.
She has a passion for cake.
Can you sing a song for everyone?
You're very understanding.
I like rock music.
There's a rumor going around.
I dropped my keys.
I should forward this information to Tom.
We go to school by bus.
Interest rates are going up.
I appreciate you being here.
I miss you so much.
She grew roses.
All of them are not present.
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
How do you know those guys won't try to kill us?
I tuck my children into bed every night.
The old chair groaned under her weight.
I've never seen you laugh.
You shouldn't ride a bicycle on the sidewalk.
His house is somewhere around here.
Have you ever had a heart attack?
The Rhine runs between France and Germany.
Are you home?
You're obnoxious.
Tom is not available at the moment. May I take a message?
I must look a sight.
She brushed her husband's hat.
Maybe I went a little too far.
The dictionary on the desk is Tom's.
Everything was happening so fast.
I blew the candle out.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
I think something is wrong.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
We'll soon find out.
I've got to get going.
I think Tom deserves that.
Tom bought a refurbished phone.
What did Tom tell Mary not to do?
I'm used to working all night.
Mary left Tom for another man.
She intended to go shopping.
Paper burns easily.
Isn't he a bit young?
Our train had already pulled out when we arrived at the station.
Please tell me where the marketplace is.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Don't tell anybody.
Are you sure they can do this?
Close the blinds.
Have you finished your homework yet?
The car came to a smooth stop.
You can't eat here.
Is this fish still alive?
I did this for you.

The patient's condition changes every day.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
Please close the curtains.

This is a wooden table.
Can I make you a drink?
She displayed her talents.
I took a week off.
I was listening carefully.
This car has a good warranty.
Give me a piece of paper.
Where's your house?
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
How fast can you do it?
I want a new dress.
Tom hates speaking in public.
We don't know why he had to leave.
I looked for him in the supermarket.
Would you like another glass of ice tea?
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
He came back home a while ago.
That girl is really shy.
It was out of his reach.
Everyone started arguing.
I wonder if Tom has one I could borrow.
I don't carry cash anymore.
My jeans shrank in the wash.
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
He ran at the sight of the policeman.
Would you like to take a recess?
I'm glad you came over.
The company announced hundreds of layoffs.
Why are you trying to make me laugh?
Where's the Red Cross?
I won't tolerate it.
I thought you'd want to try some Japanese food.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
He is a heroin addict.
There was something moving in the distance.
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
We need exercise.
I apologize to all of you.
A fork fell off the table.
We're on our way.
Tom said that it was just a coincidence.
It's a town in the middle of nowhere.
This boat is seaworthy.
He doesn't know French at all.
I like this store.
You'll have to ask Tom that.
Allow me to introduce myself.
It's about time the government did something about pollution.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
He handed in his resignation to his boss.
I hate fluorescent lighting.
Her genius makes up for her lack of experience.
The road came to a dead end.
You've got to be kidding me!
I think that he is honest.
I didn't quite know what to say.
Once upon a time, there was a pretty little house way out in the country.
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
You don't know what that means to me.
Do you know how to pronounce this word?
Well, you've convinced me.
Do you have a cellphone?
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
Did I ask your opinion?
He was determined to finish the work at any cost.
How come you know English so well?
Does a child's musical talent depend on heredity?
Don't wait up.
I persuaded him to go to the party.
It was a tradition.
He ran up the stairs breathing very hard.
You are not Japanese.
When was this car washed?
We need to go.
This will protect your skin.
I was accused of eating the boss's lunch.
I think I broke his heart.
What do you think of him?
Please mail this form to your insurance company.
She is a particularily interesting person.
Please come in.
Can you loan me thirty dollars for a cab?
I can't put up with all that noise.
We had a minor disagreement.
Tom went home at 6:30.
They're almost here.
We tried them all.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to go look after him.
It's not funny.
She is as busy as a bee.
They missed the deadline.
You never should've done that.
The day started very well.
She is used to sitting.
How fast does this car go?
I want you to be a bridesmaid.
Can I take your picture?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Cats hate to get wet.
I'm interested in mountain climbing.
Have you tried this?
Tom played the piano and Mary sang.
Unfortunately, the ambulance arrived too late.
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
Here's an important announcement.
Why does nobody answer?
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
How did you get them?
Poland is a big country.
We shouldn't ask why.
It is impossible to substitute machines for people.
Tom put on some clothes.
Have you considered therapy?
Please give me the menu.
He was surprised to learn this.
Don't judge others by the color of their skin.
Look, I'm being serious.
You look so handsome.
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee.
I don't see any options.
He tried to gain her affection.
I can't remember the secret code.
Come over.
I'm not doing it anymore.
Is Tom drunk?
Who were you protecting?
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
Counting sheep helps you to fall sleep.
We can't avoid postponing our departure.
I miss you very much.
I went to donate blood today.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone would be willing to help me.
He's a senior.
We like it.
I want you to know that.
Connect the two cables together.
You're the tallest person here.
He's used to speaking in public.
I wish you had told me the truth then.
I'm looking for a wallet.
They clung together for warmth.
I'm shooting.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
How are you going to do that?
I'm sure he mistook me for my sister.
This is a great business opportunity.
Don't put anything in the bag.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
You shouldn't use somebody else's toothbrush.
He makes no half-hearted attempts.
One of my bags is missing.
I thought they'd heard us.
No one was late.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
They're coming.
Tom started clearing the table.
We agree on this point.
Didn't I mention that?
I just guessed.
What color are your wife's eyes?
When the man saw a policeman, he fled.
Don't be so pessimistic.
Are your parents with you?
I quoted some famous phrases in my book.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I have ten times as many books as you have.
If you have something to say, just say it.
He doesn't play video games.
This book contains forty photographs.
Don't be disgusting.
I'm a new student.
Where were these pictures taken?
How is everyone?
Tom hopes he doesn't become a workaholic like his father.
You said you figured out why.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
Tom put on his coat and left.
You're so picky.
He came just as I was leaving.
It is wrong to cheat at cards.
You don't sound convinced.
Don't you want to help?
"How's it going?" "Not too bad."
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
This book is too expensive.
Tom spoke French.
You've been busy, haven't you?
This was supposed to be simple.
Humans only live about 70 years.
He's studying.
They'll eat those.
He's eating lunch now.
Tom is not going to be happy about this.
Such a person invariably expends his physical energy more slowly.
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
I want to do that this evening.
This blue backpack is heavy.
Was I seen leaving?
It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
She is French.
It's a pity that he can't marry her.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
I had a very strange dream last night.
Tom is your uncle.
Get on with it.
I have decided to weigh myself every day starting today.
I'll be late.
Stay in bed.
I didn't find it funny at all.
Are you getting much out of that book?
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
You're going to win today.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
There is an urgent need for a new system.
Please forgive me.
Can you recommend a good dictionary to me?
What else does Tom need?
What's in there?
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Why didn't you say it like that?
We have something very important that we need to discuss.
I don't expect help.
Tom says he will never go there again.
It's really cool here.
He is generous to his friends.
I also wanted to know.
You're the only person who shows me any respect.
It was not my intention.
I guess I'd better start packing.
I'm wide awake.
Things are about to get ugly.
Clean that up.
Everyone is drunk.
I'm a teacher.
I don't want either of them.
What will you make?
Apart from a few spelling mistakes, it is a good composition.
I have no time to help you with the work.
Are you free in the afternoon?
We found the front door locked.
I may be old, but I'm not crazy.
We can't be more specific.
I bought it.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
I think you'd better lie low until she forgives you.
Summer has just begun.
How come you're not the boss?
I know a guy who's never seen snow.
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
This time, I can't help.
He said it as a joke.
I had a headache, and I took the day off today.
They laughed at my idea.
Break it down.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
He knows how to play the piano.
There are almost no books.
Tom can't touch his toes.
A slight cold prevented me from going to Ibusuki with my family.
Nobody cares who you are.
I didn't know the exact procedure.
We resumed negotiations with that company.
I can protect you.
It rained all day yesterday.
At last, we got to the lake.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
I was just unlucky.
I really don't want to be alone tonight.
It was so dark that I couldn't see anything.
I wish there were more people like you.
Tom's asleep.
Does anyone see a difference?
Who is able to explain this to me?
I don't remember you at all.
I accompanied her on a walk.
Let's just not talk anymore.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
She has a bad habit of talking a long time on the phone.
He came in through the window.
They are very compatible.
I plan on winning.
There wasn't any special hurry.
That never was an issue.
Tom said that he was busy.
Tom wants a beer.
Two of them were drowned.
A group of children were playing in the park.
She lived all her life in that town.
Life is like a game of chess.
She went to the museum by taxi.
Can you help me clean this up?
Tom is the ranking officer.
Tom swims better than I do.
I've got so much left to do.
Tom couldn't stop laughing.
This place isn't so bad.
Keep your room clean.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
Don't you recognize that man?
He is a diplomat at the American Embassy.
He rang the doorbell.
Mary is Tom's fiancée.
No matter how hard you may study, you cannot master English in a year or two.
That was a cheap shot.
My boss is twice as old as I am.
It was proved that he was a thief.
Could I get a receipt?
They furnished the library with many books.
We are subject to the laws of nature.
Which is mine?
Beef, please.
That guy has a screw loose!
He's open-minded.
Cars took the place of bicycles.
We must be cautious.
Everything is on schedule.
I'm ambitious.
She performed her duties.
Who are you going to send that to?
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
Everybody hates you.
It's not worth much.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
How long were you gone?
We've been invited to a costume party.
We're fixing it.
He taught himself French.
You can't back out.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
That's not important now.
He surrendered.
I think they did it on purpose.
Have you made your decision yet?
Would you like to go to fishing with me this weekend?
I feel much safer now.
That's just a cheap publicity stunt.
I made a snowman.
Isn't it a lovely morning?
It is too expensive.
I didn't go.
His opinion was the same as mine.
You should've started without me.
I didn't like my teacher.
I'm sure that'll change soon.
The food supplies will not hold out till then.
Have something to eat.
All their efforts were in vain.
You are wrong.
It was very cold.
I'd advise you to not drink that water.
Whose glasses are these?
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
She forgave him for killing her father.
I always wear an overcoat when its cold.
I intend to stay in Nagoya for three days.
What kind of car are you driving?
He left after he had lunch.
I've managed to persuade Tom to come.
There were too many children in the pool.
I've just found out who you are.
I almost shot you.
He painted a dog.
To tell the truth, I don't like him.
His plane leaves for Hong Kong at 2:00 p.m.
You might not want to mention that.
I don't know what is worse.
You can't save me.
Get in the car now.
He arrived after the bell rang.
Why do you keep giving him money?
That was a bad decision.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
You're winning.
I must go.
I'm not in good shape.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
Come and warm yourself by the fire.
I realize it's hard to believe.
I need to see Tom again.
I can't believe Tom did that to you.
This is yours, isn't it?
We want Tom to know he can come home.
What're you doing today?
That's probably a good idea.
Why do you despise people?
I can't hear anything because of the noise.
How much money did you win?
I'll read anything.
I arrived in Tokyo at noon.
No one knows where we are.
What was your favorite part?
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
The beaches are less crowded in September.
We should cut our losses.
We have no proof.
Do you actually believe this?
She asked him some questions.
I just want to make it home in one piece.
She did it easily.
We're not serious.
She's a fixture at all the high-society parties.
I turned on the lights.
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
I know they're still alive.
There is no use in making excuses.
People can turn to the law if they want to correct an injustice.
I thought that you'd understand.
Tom took care of our children last weekend.
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
Come back home.
The room was filled with people.
I know what it's like to be alone.
These cookies aren't expensive, but they taste good.
Are you allergic to any medicine?
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
I think you know what I think.
I need to renew my passport.
Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends.
Are you sure you're not tired?
How did you end up here?
We really have a lot to do.
I didn't hear you come in.
You should go home now.
I don't have to clean my room.
I haven't spoken with Tom yet.
Tom has well-defined muscles.
I'm going.
Tom intends to stay in Boston for three days.
Can I rely on you?
He will have to undergo an operation next week.
Smoking in bed is dangerous.
Meiji was beaten by Keio by a score of three to five.
I saw the moon above the roof.
This coffee is not hot enough.
You're not a very good liar.
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
Do you really think Tom was mistaken?
I have a black eye.
Lay it on the table.
You're not very tidy.
I guess not.
The treatment is going successfully.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
Tom broke his leg in a cycling accident.
I will have graduated from college by the time you come back from America.
He calculated the speed of light.
You can fix all this.
I told Tom Mary was telling the truth.
I used to love that.
I like stories.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
Tom is on the roof.
We don't need these things.
Do you agree?
Despite all his setbacks, he remains an optimist.
Someone was calling my name.
I smell blood.
Let's go to a movie.
Do you think something like that will repeat itself?
I need paint.
I can't find it.
I want you to know how sorry I am.
Have you already eaten?
You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?
He decided not to go.
Watch me.
I'll help you.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
Thanks for stopping by.
Don't tease me.
Tom wants to see Mary in his office.
Tom isn't here. He went home.
Why are you calling Tom?
I'd like to visit England someday.
I don't like loose ends.
It never occurred to me to take a picture of how the garden looked before we started pulling weeds.
I know Tom has gone to Boston.
Did you hear that a burglar broke into the neighbor's house?
I never dreamed that I would meet her there.
I want it.
Birds have sharp eyes.
Tom works a lot.
She knows ten times as many English words as I do.
Websites collect information about you.
Who else do you want on your team?
I was ready to do it.
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
I really appreciate your coming.
What are you watching?
What were you thinking?
I'm thrilled.
You're not bleeding.
I'd like to ask you about how to do that.
Don't burn yourself.
I will ask him tomorrow.
Please open the door.
How long does it take to get to the stadium?
I don't have a home.
Let's get it over with.
I was shocked to see this.
Things can't be all that bad.
Tom intends to change that.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
We hate violence.
I must run.
I need a hammer.
She went into the room and lay on the bed.
Do you know why this date is important?
This book is written in simple English, so it should be easy for you to read.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
Where did you hear that?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wasn't hired.
Not every country belongs to the U.N.
I'll get off here.
The dogs died inside the hot vehicle.
What are you crunching on?
She devoted herself to him.
Read it to me.
It's not legally binding.
I lost my car keys.
Tie the horse to that tree.
Tom pulled out his gun.
I said I was sad.
That's all I remember.
I'll need to make some more tests.
I really want a motorcycle.
He wrote a letter.
I want one!
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Shut the door tight.
Your question is not relevant to the subject.
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
I'm still not impressed.
You won't believe it.
The policeman captured the man who was running.
I'm no different than you.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
I had to find out for myself.
He sent me a birthday card.
Tom speaks French fluently.
What's going on?
They asserted that it was true.
We had to stop.
This type of thing never used to happen here.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
He threw the letter into the fire.
It's not known who first invented the wheel.
The ship is now in the harbor.
I feel safe with you.
I don't share your optimism.
You're a good man.
Tom lost his car key.
It is difficult to understand his theory.
I thought it over and decided not to go.
I am single.
He doesn't work here now, but he used to work here.
I'm in love with somebody else.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
Buy a book and read it.
I wrote it for Tom.
What is going on?
Give them to him.
I think you're too picky.
Your cat is overweight.
Bring me today's paper, please.
I want to go to bed early.
I never wanted to harm you.
Do you know what he said?
We left no stone unturned.
That's all they had.
He was among those chosen.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
I'm assuming this is your father.
He was very tall, so I recognized him at once.
Where shall I wait for you?
You're very efficient.
They won't make it.
All of my friends have bicycles.
I have poor eyesight.
I liked that book.
This is our main goal.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Won't somebody please help me?
You should have done so.
I really am glad you're here.
Tom certainly had a lot of time to think about it.
What are you majoring in?
Tom never helps me.
You're unforgettable.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
When were you born?
I believe the answer is yes.
You're free to go.
Do you like Wagner?
I don't hear barking.
Attach labels to all the bags.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
Can you pick me up at the station?
Doesn't that smell great?
Things might get a little rough.
My computer has frozen.
His story may not be true.
Will you join our club?
I haven't got a chance.
It didn't hurt at all.
Don't open your umbrella in the hall.
I can't believe that you actually got into Harvard.
I got up at seven this morning.
How old is your grandfather?
She blackmailed him.
Scream as loud as you can.
I left my umbrella behind in the taxi.
Whose son are you?
Look down at the floor.
I feel sorry for you.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Tom often walks to school.
Tom said he's tired of eating Chinese food.
Her father became an invalid as a result of a heart attack.
Would you like a little company?
I'd like to go to Boston someday.
Tom is slowly catching up with the rest of the class.
Tom didn't tell Mary his secret.
You should have breakfast every day.
I was drinking milk.
She sent him a postcard.
You can expect to receive a little something from us soon.
She kept on working.
We saw the film and had dinner together.
I went to Europe by way of Anchorage.
He said two or three words and left.
What did you hear?
Your door was unlocked.
The crowd applauded for several minutes.
We could tell Tom was scared.
We have the same group of friends.
I'm not afraid of death.
We shouldn't have bought this car.
Some prominent tennis players behave like spoiled brats.
Come and see me any time you like.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
Are you there?
I really like being with you.
I'm not giving up yet.
I'm glad we did that.
She walked as fast as she could to catch up with him.
What do you have to say about that?
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Tom began praying.
I can't predict the future.
I do not want any money.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
The weather changes very often in England.
I only want to know the facts.
My father is absent on business.
What's the next station?
I think we should all go outside.
Aren't you dressed yet?
There must be something else we can do.
I can't be without you.
We often went skiing in the winter.
What's the big emergency?
May I have a road map?
Please correct me if I make a mistake.
They're all fake.
Don't open your book.
You really didn't know, did you?
He set fire to the school building.
The old man was almost hit by a car.
Why do you keep giving him money?
I'm really sleepy.
Mom bought a puppy for us.
I finished writing the report.
I'll be there.
I saw him enter the room.
The street is full of cars.
I saw them enter the bank.
I'm too drunk to do that.
I do not understand.
It's very hard to get along with him.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
Do you have a twin sister?
Do you have anything to do tonight?
I live here with my dog.
Show me an example.
I don't trust you.
Say please.
The size of the universe is unimaginable.
She was about to go out.
Look at this mess.
I think we can do better.
Do you want to do this?
We're in town.
Colds are prevalent this winter.
Were you happy?
Tom has been patiently waiting all morning.
Let me write down the directions for you.
Leave this to me.
I have met neither of his sons.
What are you saying?
Tom finished his chores and then he did his homework.
Is it OK if I kiss you?
It's an important step.
I like what you did with your hair.
She knows everything about cooking.
You need to grow up.
They're clean.
Every bus is full.
We had a very hot summer this year.
I went to Tom's apartment.
Be nicer to your sister.
The idea of surprising her suddenly crossed my mind.
If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
If you behave like a flunkey, you're treated like a flunkey.
When did you get married?
I want to know what you're doing here.
The sun is brighter than the moon.
"When do you get up?" "I get up at eight."
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
I like teaching.
Did you mention my book?
Is there any adverse reaction?
I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
Look out for pickpockets.
It was a dreary day and Tom didn't feel like going out.
Please come.
I can't keep up with you if you walk so fast.
What do you say we go there?
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
She demanded to see the manager.
There's nothing we can't do.
We're meant for each other.
My wife is cooking.
I like the way you talk.
We're both insane.
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
I have a coat, but I have no hat.
How dare you accuse me of lying!
Open the windows.
She was the last to cross the finishing line.
Above all, be patient.
He has a strong body.
Can you make it safe?
He told his son an interesting story.
I have to study for a biology test.
The shortage of manpower poses a big problem for us.
I hate this school.
He made me go.
It's not about them.
You might want to take a look at this.
Check it out!
I ate with my baby brother.
Give us a ride downtown.
Somebody's coming.
I've got a lot of good ideas.
We haven't yet discussed that problem.
I've just finished breakfast.
Tom won't come, and Mary won't either.
I had no idea.
This laptop belongs to me.
Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
What's the weather like?
Could you tell me what time it is?
I think you know everyone here.
When will you get married?
What do you want to talk to me about?
You won't be shot.
We should not impose our opinions on other people.
Tom leaned over the bridge.
You've got to be making this up.
They're just students.
There's no wind today.
I don't really want to be here.
You had better read a lot of books while you are young.
I just wanted you to accept me.
I was thinking of getting one.
I'm sure you did what you thought was the right thing to do.
I'm leaving for Canada tomorrow.
Those houses are big.
I think this is important.
All of Tom's predictions came true.
I can't make myself understood in German.
I am already forgetting my grandmother's face.
I wholeheartedly agree.
How much is it?
Don't you ever say that again.
You said you were going to handle it.
Let's divide this money between you and me.
I was devastated.
He was very kind to invite me to his birthday party.
She hardly ate anything.
I think it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to do that by yourself.
The problem should be solved.
It's getting light. Morning is coming.
Tom doesn't often visit us.
Did I miss much?
She bought this pen at that store.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
I want to catch the 11:45.
I had some help.
It is said the house is haunted.
You're winning, aren't you?
I told you so.
You should quit smoking.
It doesn't count.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I'm just a little dizzy.
Tom often cuts class.
It was fun while it lasted.
That took guts.
Tom loves you. I know he does.
I hope we don't have to sell our house.
I know his address, but it's a secret.
I don't believe that.
Could you show me how to do that?
The loss adds up to more than one million dollars.
Would you be willing to help?
I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet.
Tom made me read this book.
There's something I want to show you.
I remember this music.
My baby brother still wets his bed.
Don't tell me what I already know.
I'm getting old.
I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the bus.
I think I can prove it.
He's playing with my cat.
I'm not doing it anymore.
Minorities are despised in many countries.
We've just cleaned the toilets.
Where is the school?
I don't like going out by myself at night.
I'm planning to stay at a hotel.
Remove your hat.
You're a wonderful friend.
We have to clear the snow off the roof.
You should go to bed.
She made him rich.
You must exercise more care in writing English.
What kind of bread do you like best?
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
The lake is deepest at this spot.
If you were to hear him speak French, you would take him for a Frenchman.
I work every day except Sunday.
We should write a formal letter to the director.
Remember to mail the letter on your way to school.
I'm getting too old for this job.
The noise set the dog barking.
You seemed to like that.
The dog nipped at me.
I was wondering when you were going to tell me you loved me.
Don't take any chances.
I'm sure Tom will do that.
Do you want coffee?
May I sit here?
I want a third alternative.
I've got to speak to you.
Those are all important.
Can you count to ten in Chinese?
The alarm clock is ringing.
Don't tell my wife.
Let's call it a night.
Don't tell anyone this.
I've never seen that man before in my life.
When I heard the news, I cried.
Do you want to take that risk?
Tom brushed his daughter's hair.
Read it once more, please.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach.
How did your test go?
I like things done properly.
It seems to me that I heard a noise in the attic.
You wouldn't have won without me.
She is wearing an expensive necklace.
Do you want to hear my theory?
You probably could've done that better.
From now on, I will not use that word.
We're doing the wrong thing.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
I just wanted to say that I love you.
You'll be the first to know.
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
Stop staring.
I will help you.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
She talked him into buying a new house.
On the whole, the Japanese are conservative.
Everyone's there.
Tom showed me the poems that he'd written when he was a teenager.
What fell on me?
What foreign countries would you like to visit?
I thought you read my resume.
Far from being a failure, it was a great success.
Tom is not here.
I know I should've done that.
This'll only take a moment.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
Could you gift wrap it?
I'm not wearing socks.
Are you still not convinced?
Stop being so nice to me.
They were only interested in selling books.
Buy me a drink.
Tom didn't want to think about it anymore.
Put your hat back on.
Oh, please don't say that.
I asked Tom for some help.
Who is there?
I wrote down his phone number.
They found each other.
Have you ever been run over?
How can they just make up stuff like that?
This word has two meanings.
Where are your friends going?
I like westerns.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I don't feel like talking.
I want you back today.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
I'm astonished.
My father doesn't like music.
You're probably thirsty.
Are you interested in politics?
He is always saying bad things about others.
Give me some time to think.
Give someone else a chance.
The table was covered with paper.
Did you know this was coming down?
"When poverty comes in the door, love flies out the window" is a saying as old as it is sad.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Do you understand how serious this is?
You said you were going to handle it.
I'm not a child.
They can't start without me.
Drink it down.
I prefer red wine to white wine.
Do you want your coat back?
This is dangerous territory.
I'm just not very busy.
I thought we were welcome here.
Please stop.
He has a sense of humor.
I don't have time to argue with you.
You knew, didn't you?
When do you plan to start?
They will be safe with her.
Does Tom want me to say something?
Who are you closest to in your family?
I wanted red shoes.
I really loved working here.
For now, I will wait at the hotel.
Tom looks dazed.
Use the manual override.
Sometimes I get carried away.
I find that fascinating.
You're arrogant.
How do you intend to do it?
Why are you so secretive?
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
Everything is OK.
We're going to freeze to death.
You continue making the same mistakes time after time.
That's a good thing to have.
I'm eating an apple.
When will we go home?
I've never been to New York, and my sister hasn't, either.
I want you to give me a job.
He looks strong.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Run and hide in the mountains.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
Do you write in French?
How do you think I felt?
Tom doesn't want Mary to touch him.
Unfortunately, it's raining today.
I wonder if there's a connection.
She went shopping.
Tom seems calm.
I didn't think that you could do that.
Someone has stolen our clothes.
We all cried.
Do I have to pay you?
Do you remember your grandfather?
I caught Tom looking into the neighbors' windows.
When are you coming to Melbourne again?
I don't have any children yet.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
I suppose that's all right.
Everybody was startled.
I will protect you.
How was your summer?
They know our plans.
Keep focused on your work.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Are you still happy?
I'm as tall as my father.
Take care not to catch a cold.
Tom has to go even if it rains.
Tom said you were good at chess.
How did he ever get so lucky?
I love playing Chopin.
The boy told me why he was crying.
I will choose one of them.
What should I do with that?
I really need a job.
I just wanted to look at you.
Think it over and tell me what you decide.
I'm going to shut up now.
It was a good choice.
I think we'd better do that.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
I have one brother.
I was really emotional.
Fishing is prohibited here.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.
I feel empowered.
Did you see anyone leave?
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
I'm your sister.
Can I do anything?
It's a lot of trouble to write my name, because it takes 50 strokes to write both my first and last names.
It's unusual for you to do something like that.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
That's always a good sign.
I will come, weather permitting.
You're losing.
We're all crazy.
I have finally reached my limit.
I've heard about it. Your parents disappeared, running out on their debt didn't they?
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit.
I don't think Tom realized just how much Mary loved him.
I mean it.
He's a nerd.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
Don't open the present yet.
Do you plan to stay long?
It's natural for you to think so.
He brought us sad news.
I can barely understand what he's saying.
I can't thank you enough.
What do you think this sentence means?
Call a doctor immediately.
She has a little money put aside.
I had a situation to take care of.
Three-fourths of the earth's surface is covered with water.
I'm going to be gone soon.
Just shut up and listen.
Our headquarters are in Boston.
You don't sound very confident.
It's not my style.
I am going to be an engineer.
Tom is a stubborn man.
It was his silence that made her angry.
You may kiss the bride.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
How long will the operation take?
He was right the first time.
Take a look at this report.
I sometimes hear my father singing in the bath.
People are looking at us.
I prefer reading books to watching television.
I suppose I could wait a little longer.
I failed miserably.
Tom was a good guy.
Tom wants to start from scratch.
What is your decision?
Finally, he reached his goal.
I showed the postcard I got from Mary to Tom.
She seems to be nervous about her first class.
Excess of politeness is annoying.
Tom is very stubborn.
You don't have a fever.
Let me carry it for you.
They left him for dead.
This word is derived from Latin.
I want a scooter.
I thought we weren't going to go there.
You're welcome.
Come downstairs as soon as possible.
He died from lack of oxygen.
The police told me not to leave town.
I pointed at him.
Lawyers are all liars.
Our ammunition has run out.
Tom likes to go to the beach.
Do you know what Tom was wearing?
Were you spying on me?
I just can't help you right now.
He's a powerful sorcerer.
Your answer is right.
Tom looks just like a guy I know.
Don't make me do it again.
Take my hand.
I really like being alone.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
She's very afraid of snakes.
She seems rich.
I had a lot on my mind.
You have no idea how important you are to me.
She hit him.
Someone attacked Tom.
He is enjoying his school life.
I would like to eat something.
Bad weather is no obstacle.
That feels amazing.
He bribed the judge and got off scot-free.
If he had been a little more careful, the accident would have been avoided.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
You need to go on a diet.
That was sweet.
A man appeared at the door.
They used a high-speed camera.
As far as I know, he is a person who keeps his promises.
Which of you came here first?
What you decided to do is insane.
We're crazy about each other.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
Can I have some tea?
It's an ecological disaster.
He traveled around the country.
Are you sure you know what to do?
Now what's the deal?
Take me to your place.
Do you know who she is?
Do I have to come home now?
Are you still interested?
Both Tom and I aren't busy.
I'll be there Monday night.
Tom showed us a photo of his mother.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
I canceled it.
What's your favorite lipstick brand?
I forgot you don't like carrots.
Could you tie it with a ribbon?
Her son was killed in a traffic accident.
It's not that deep.
He inherited an old wooden chest.
Tom has denied the allegation.
I don't walk a lot.
Tom seems to have it in for me.
You can't leave me.
No matter how he tried, he could not open the door.
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
I hate it when Tom and Mary fight.
Tom turned on the light.
I don't care that Tom doesn't like me.
Are we sinking?
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
She is kind to old people.
The whole class was quiet.
What do you think of this sweater?
I have been busy today.
Carelessness often causes accidents.
We'd better go help Tom.
Listen a minute.
I gave Tom everything he asked for.
It is really time for us to go.
Have you ever been a witness in a court case?
You've already explained that.
Who told you to do that?
Did you call me last night?
We had a heavy rainfall last night.
Do not underestimate my power.
I'd be happy to cooperate.
You're very intelligent.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Are you deaf or something?
I will shoot him.
It wasn't a surprise.
Tom has committed a serious crime.
He showed us some pictures.
Your country thanks you.
She can't find her keys.
Aren't you going to say something?
His silence surprised me.
Drink this juice.
Can't this boat go any faster?
I didn't think you needed one.
I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.
I know when I'm not wanted.
I never wanted to hurt you.
Tom is dangerous.
She was afraid of the dog.
I'm not busy either.
Where are they taking you?
I'm entitled to my own opinion.
I weighed myself on the bathroom scales.
Who would you like to speak to?
I'm just going out a minute.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I can't conceive of living without him.
He works as a translator.
I can't believe what we were about to do.
I don't want to open the window.
I'm really looking forward to relaxing this weekend.
She has long hair.
Tom pressed the intercom button.
Tom sounds angry.
We intended to stay there about two weeks.
We will visit our teacher next week.
I just want to ask you some questions.
One of the aircraft's engines cut out.
I don't know what it's for.
Tom is doing fine.
Tom has made up his mind already.
I think it's very deceptive.
I got tired with the work.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
We left the door open.
When will the new magazine come out?
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
Tom doesn't like being criticized.
He held out his hand and I took it.
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
This type of cat has no tail.
You're Germans, aren't you?
You've got a great memory.
I don't even know where to start.
Tom is a bad coach.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
Corporations aren't people.
We must work hard to break down social barriers.
What on earth is it?
You can tell me anything.
Possibly the factory will be closed down next week.
Call me after you talk to Tom.
It won't take me much time to do that.
Tom can swim, can't he?
I can't eat all this.
We must start at the beginning.
Did you tell Tom?
That only makes it worse.
The athletic meet was put off until next week.
Do you think I look like my brother?
You're not tired, are you?
When do you think he'll be back?
I promised not to tell.
He dreaded having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
We're saving lives.
How about playing golf tomorrow?
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
I'm afraid that he can't do it.
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
Tom couldn't eat solid food for a week.
I'm sorry, my mother's not at home.
She stood transfixed as if she had seen a ghost.
Parents teach their children that it's wrong to lie.
I want your love.
The cat is under the table.
There is a strong bond between the brothers.
It would be good to sleep, even for just a little bit.
I feel like I'm making progress.
You don't seem so smart.
Two small bottles, please.
Their rooms are always clean.
I don't want to buy this kind of sofa.
No one's convinced.
Do you know why he has been absent from school?
I don't understand what's happening to me.
You're winning.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
I'm not crying.
China is about twenty-five times as large as Japan.
The house was more expensive than I had expected.
I thought I'd never see you alive again.
We're not fussy.
I was going to call him, but thought better of it.
Did you have a nice evening?
Tom cut his finger on a piece of glass.
She takes care of my children.
Recently, they have not been giving her her paycheck on time.
I'm in love with you.
What's the accusation against him?
That should do it.
This is a difficult problem, and it is not easy for anyone to decide.
My father drives very well.
It's a sequel.
It just makes no sense.
That's so sweet of you.
You seem to be a busy man.
Where's Boston?
It's better to be approximately right than completely wrong.
My wife is a vegetarian.
What did you buy it for?
There was nothing I could've done.
I'm looking for my wallet. Have you seen it?
Tom was a trusted friend.
Aren't you satisfied?
It's necessary for you to go.
They slept in the same room.
Would you like to see my new car?
Check, please.
We've all seen it.
They're very close friends.
I question your sincerity.
The old castle is in a sad state.
Many revolutions have aimed to abolish the aristocracy.
They're in the hot tub.
I have visited Boston three times.
I wondered if her story was true.
I'm constantly telling her to behave herself.
The problem is you're not patient enough.
We don't want Tom to go.
Keep these rules in mind.
We enjoy talking.
I always enjoy hearing you sing.
You already know who I'm talking about, don't you?
I'm going to cook for you.
By chance, I found a hot spring.
I bet you're right.
Read this passage and translate it into Japanese.
It was just a lucky guess.
There isn't room for everyone.
I saw what you did.
Who's your teacher?
We want them to follow us.
Is this typewriter yours?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
I do want to be your friend.
At least they listened to me.
I can't help you because I am busy.
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
Can you remember his name?
Do they have money?
Could you please be quiet?
Have you heard from her recently?
There are some things that are difficult to translate.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
I've learned a lot about modern authors.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I left a message for Tom.
I like studying wild flowers.
I hope that I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
What do you remember?
Be polite, but firm.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't help Tom.
I'm sick and tired of reading.
We just need to stay calm.
I was too tired to walk any more.
I have few books.
I'm always happy.
Tom stood in line.
I finally found time to sit down and read the newspaper.
You don't need a list.
Aren't you done with this?
The company's insolvency forced it to file for bankruptcy.
Tom began to get downhearted.
She is as young as I am.
Which one would you take?
I called for help.
We postponed the event.
I thought that Tom was kind.
Did you get the check?
I don't like kids.
That's all I needed to hear.
It was very ugly.
I can do it faster on my own.
Tom has to call his grandmother.
Children imitate their friends rather than their parents.
Bring your student ID!
Everybody is sore.
It's important to have an off-site backup of all the data on your computer.
I'd like to sing a song for you that I just wrote.
She ordered him to clean up his room.
Don't be so greedy or you'll wind up with nothing.
Get out of the water.
I noticed the difference.
His book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
I knew that already.
May I do that now?
Her anger is understandable.
We ate at the food court.
I know something you don't.
Don't you move or I'll shoot.
I was totally isolated.
Tie your shoe.
I just started crying.
The meeting is all over.
Could you show me how to do that?
The movie starts at ten o'clock.
We're all working together.
He was jealous of my success.
He was very happy.
It's late, so turn off the TV.
You don't have the time.
The sun is about to set.
That could've been prevented.
He is about thirty.
I can't bear the pain anymore.
You're so impatient.
I will shoot him.
Is that the future?
I went skiing a lot as a kid.
Safety is the primary concern.
It looks good on you.
I don't disagree with your decision.
I hope you behaved well at school today.
Tom liked to gamble.
I'm nervous when speaking in another language.
It must've been extremely painful.
I was meaning to call you.
I don't have much time.
We were impressed.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I lost that argument.
He's a big boy.
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds in recent years.
I was asked to fix the bicycle.
This is out of control.
Living here isn't easy.
How many people were at your party?
I don't ever want to hurt you.
That bridge is anything but safe.
We are listening to the radio.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I want to start now.
Were you watching TV last night at nine o'clock?
Are you going to mow the lawn today?
I appreciate all your help.
The news made them happy.
Don't go near the bulldog. You wouldn't want him to bite you.
I wish I had more time to spend with friends.
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
It's not my fault.
I used to think no one cared.
Is she beautiful?
I'll be back in an hour or so.
This CD is mine, isn't it?
We keep our most interesting thoughts and the most interesting side of ourselves hidden away.
You're taller than I am.
You know it as well as I do.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
The results are inconclusive.
Tom told me that he wasn't afraid of Mary.
I bought a book of folktales.
He tries.
Tom wished he could've stayed longer.
I guess you want me to leave.
Please write to me once in a while.
We now know that the testimony he gave was coerced.
That isn't enough.
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
Earth is a planet.
I can't play the piano, but she can.
She scolded him.
Tom certainly got the message.
That's of no use to me.
I am looking forward to receiving your favorable answer.
I'm too tired to walk.
I hope no one saw me dancing.
Love hurts.
Please answer in French.
I'm going to work hard.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
Who did you learn it from?
She hired him.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
Nobody came to the party.
I wonder if she will marry him.
It was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night.
Tom broke his nose.
Do you carry weapons?
Let me finish.
This will make a big difference.
There's no way out.
I hope that helps.
Don't mess up my system.
Don't forget your water bottle.
We're running late.
Tom doesn't know how computers work.
She speaks Chinese.
I didn't see you.
I met Tom on my way to school.
Tom likes him.
Funding for this program was provided by the following sponsors.
I got you something to eat.
He tried to comfort her, but she kept crying.
So, are you seeing anyone?
Do you really want me to dance with you?
I've changed clothes.
No one seems to care.
They are typical young people.
What did your mom say?
She was accepted by Harvard.
Someone cut the rope.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
This grocery store only sells organic food.
They know your name.
We should keep this information under wraps for the time being.
You don't seem too surprised.
He wrenched the letter from my hand.
It's not a joke.
I'll take a beer.
I'm not a magician.
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
I've already read it.
An elephant is a strong animal.
My brother did it on my behalf.
It was no one's fault.
He looked pretty tired.
That's reversing the logical order of things.
You don't want to get married either, right?
I figured you wouldn't want to go there without me.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
It was an advantage having learned Chinese while I was in school.
Nobody tells me anything.
We lost sight of the man in the crowd.
All the boys looked down.
She can't find her hat.
Correct the errors if there are any.
Tom has found a girlfriend.
You won't die today.
What did it look like?
Are you sure that it was Tom?
Don't give up halfway.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
There is milk all over the kitchen floor because my wife broke the bottle.
I had a horrible childhood.
She loves shopping.
The cost of living in Japan is going down.
The mechanic fixed my car without charging me a dime.
No one loves war.
I can't stop you from revealing my secrets. However, I beg you not to.
I want to know where they are.
Why didn't you listen to him?
I had a hunch you would do that.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I have no patience.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
I was just wondering how it would feel to be punched in the stomach.
We need to figure out what works and what doesn't work.
I think you know that's impossible.
He likes soccer.
I used to go fishing with my father when I was a child.
All you have to do is to do your best.
I'm living in Boston.
This article reminds me of something I saw on TV.
We're close enough.
They all looked relieved.
He tried to behave as bravely as possible while he was being held hostage.
You can't know that for sure.
I am afraid it is a reject.
He is very a dangerous man.
He never forgot his ambition to become a great politician.
Swimming makes your legs strong.
I know Tom was horrified.
Tom's not a nice guy.
Let's not fight.
His answer was far from satisfactory.
It's nice of you to give me a lift.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
There were two pieces of cake.
Be discreet.
I do not know when she can come.
She told him all about her childhood.
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on.
No one flinched.
Tom thinks that Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
Nobody can open the door.
I hate to complain.
I usually don't have time to eat a large lunch.
I admit there are a few problems.
I take everything back.
Business before pleasure.
I don't put sugar in my coffee.
Enjoy the show.
I've been here all afternoon.
His mother was ashamed of him.
Do you think Mary's skirt is too short?
The wound left a scar on her arm.
Her sister is not going to America.
I don't handle ultimatums well.
Snow completely covered the town.
Tom has a soft voice.
Most of the food we buy in supermarkets is overpackaged.
Is this why you've come back?
Are you flirting with me?
It is your constant efforts that count most in the end.
How old is your brother?
This knife doesn't cut well.
Are you tired of living?
Do you want to come out and play?
I'd appreciate that.
We should try to understand one another.
She overslept.
Employees are prohibited from watching the Olympics.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
Tom didn't look as bored as Mary.
I met Mary yesterday.
I want to watch you dance.
Tom never stays more than a week.
The solution was obvious.
He tricked me.
I'd like to go out with you.
Did you read them?
That's not my job.
I can't live without her.
You're very lonely.
We came back to camp before dark.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Everybody in the park looked up at the hot air balloon.
I asked the villagers many times to let me die.
How does it feel to be a mother?
I was invited to Tom's party.
His health ebbed slowly away.
You're running out of options.
Have you ever opened this door?
It's one of those moments.
I have nothing to say right now.
Ask at the police station over there.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
How is your daughter?
You can come if you want to.
Was it a hard decision?
We bought the car for $12,000.
Tom, it's not your fault.
Some people take a bath every day and others don't.
Please give me the menu.
She was accused of telling a lie.
It works.
Why are they fighting?
Are you off your rocker?
He did it for the money.
If there was just 1,000 yen more, he would have taken 10,000 yen in total.
Did anybody force you to do that?
Stop making a fuss.
They tried to cheer me up.
We spent the whole evening talking to them.
I think it's time to eat.
Can you help her out before they catch her?
You're not missing much.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still a child.
What he said is true.
You're not alone.
She doesn't understand you.
We will make it public.
I have to do this before class.
You should do that right now.
I'm a minister.
Tom really likes traveling.
He can run faster than me.
Tom said he'd like to see Mary do that.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
It seems likely.
I won't ask you to do that.
There are many wild animals in this area.
I work as a museum attendant.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We have people everywhere.
Here I come.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
He was so kind as to help us.
What kind of sports do you do?
I got confused.
Are you free on Tuesday?
They won't find it.
From the hill, we could see all the buildings in the city.
It is a long story.
I never forgot that.
I realized I couldn't win.
Things escalated quickly.
Once you have made a promise, you should keep it.
It'll rain for sure.
You can't just not do your job.
I took on the job of proofreading.
Wait one moment.
That's a blatant lie.
Do you still remember how to do it?
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
There isn't any film in this camera.
Where were they sent?
What time is the concert?
I'm right here.
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
We have decided to adopt your idea.
The pond is 100 meters in diameter.
Foreign workers make up 30% of his company.
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
Where did she buy books?
I will never forgive you.
I'm a beginner, too.
She will be a famous artist in the future.
You don't know how bad I want to leave.
Tom said he wanted to dye his hair black.
Are you wondering what we ended up doing?
Did you tell anybody?
What are you complaining about?
I was there.
Both motorcyclists were wearing helmets.
She is ashamed of what she's done.
Let's not argue.
I agree with your opinion.
He believed that blacks could win their fight for equal rights without violence.
I'm timid.
You have a pretty good memory.
I don't feel like taking a walk this morning.
Don't come near me.
I think it's about time we got started.
I paid in cash.
Did he stay very long?
Can anyone help me?
Did you know this was coming down?
We were busy.
How much money did you spend on your car?
You went surfing this morning, didn't you?
A good night's sleep will do you a world of good.
I am not used to staying up late at night.
Some kinds of birds can't fly.
May I eat that cake?
We're reliable.
Who told you to bring me here?
We're going to miss doing this.
Tom isn't really as rich as everyone thinks he is.
He stood there with his eyes closed.
There were survivors.
Three of the men involved in the accident were hospitalized.
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
I just wanted to check my email.
How about running?
She showed me which dress to wear.
I get a haircut every month.
I made a big mistake.
I want to get this done today.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
Tom has no insurance.
I cannot stand this noise.
He constantly criticizes other people.
I'd like to buy you a beer.
I need more information on this matter.
You should give up smoking.
There is no alternative.
You're very sophisticated.
Many people were killed in the plane accident.
Americans admire Lincoln for his honesty.
What a weakling!
I can't believe I locked myself out again.
The government explicitly declared its intention to lower taxes.
Tom never should've told you that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom hasn't bought his ticket yet.
I dream in French.
He is a scientist.
They admire each other.
Somebody has broken this dish.
English is spoken in many countries.
I'll be your teacher.
I've decided not to swim this afternoon.
No one ever knew the true story except the three of us.
The boys have gone north.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'll explain to you how to use it when I come back.
What do I get out of it?
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
Tom stole it.
I need more information on this matter.
It is time you told her the truth.
We bought a pound of tea.
You're early.
She can speak French fluently.
I was too afraid to say anything.
No one comes to visit me anymore.
That's what I want most of all.
I was hoping we could still be friends.
Tom fired Mary.
They've changed the rules.
We're trying to close the box.
Don't you think so?
How did we do that?
Get in the van.
I don't want any problems.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
The car is ready.
Tom admitted he had accepted a bribe.
I get the idea.
Has he arrived already?
This is your last opportunity.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow.
Did you come here alone?
Why do you want a dog?
She took care of the child.
We must keep a diary every day.
Hold your position.
I didn't know I was invited.
Don't forget your phone.
I watched an old movie on TV.
Tom is not able to drive a car.
She doesn't hate him. In fact, she loves him.
She taught him everything she knew.
How much did they give you for your old car?
I know how hard that is.
I'm sorry, but I cannot answer right away.
What would you like?
Tom felt his phone vibrate.
The exhibition was very impressive.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
Please come again two weeks from today.
I am to meet him at six.
I've done everything I was supposed to do.
This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
She is really into knitting.
I don't tell people what to eat.
Tom won't leave until he's talked to Mary.
I need another drink.
You don't even know how.
I have to try.
One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
How could you say that?
You're so picky.
How did you get out of your room?
We elected him chairman.
I found out who did that.
He finally found out how to make it.
Anyone could do that.
The house is built of red bricks.
What has become of your sister?
You should've turned left.
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
Things were different in those days.
No one is irreplaceable.
You must show respect to your guests.
The moon is the earth's only satellite.
I wish I were a bird.
Let's take a short break.
I usually eat lunch at 11:30 to avoid the rush.
I want to sit by the window.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
Let's hope it stays that way.
Tom doesn't know who Mary is going to go to Boston with.
It's not your fault.
I don't understand art.
We were very busy last week.
You must pay attention to him.
Come along with us.
You ought to have been more careful.
They were afraid of being overheard.
She scolded him.
I don't want to go.
He mentioned it.
I was busy yesterday.
I shouldn't have gone there.
Tom pushed Mary out the window.
How would you analyze the situation?
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
How's it going to happen?
He has little money with him.
I had forgotten all about today's meeting. I'm glad you reminded me.
This is my last offer.
Your shoes don't go with that outfit.
My father won't allow me to do that.
I'll not make that mistake again.
Tom and Mary dated for 3 years.
I got out of the taxi.
He no longer works here.
This form looks kind of complicated. Help me fill it out.
A plastic dish will melt on the stove.
I always buy expensive items on credit.
It's phony.
The boats collided head on.
We will keep the room warm.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
Do you want beef or pork?
He's really into soccer.
She has brains.
How much is that?
It is hardly raining.
I'm not convinced that you're telling the truth.
How did you learn how to play the violin?
That is our baseball field.
He doesn't want you to lose a whole week.
Everybody is relying on you.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
I'd like you to go to the supermarket and buy some bread.
Tom seemed disappointed.
My strength is all gone.
Your father's friends aren't his only supporters.
It's pretty cold.
We're just practicing.
He is likely to win the game.
If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask.
What's the difference between these?
What happened?
You're careless.
Go two blocks and turn left.
My aunt looks young.
We can't put a young boy in prison.
We all know what happened here.
Are you ready for Christmas?
I was the only one not invited to the party.
I needed help.
He's your son.
Am I speaking too quickly?
Tom's innocent.
No one answered my question.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
The car crashed into the truck.
Don't use computer translation.
Fake it till you make it.
Would you do me a favor?
They ate up all the cake.
If he'd been there, he'd have told you to mind your manners.
They approve.
I hope you all understand.
I showed Tom the postcard I got from Mary.
That was my intent.
Tom didn't know where to park his car.
We'll need their help.
She's six years older than me.
It was Tom that saved the girl.
I guess that's OK.
I'm studying English.
That's your favorite, right?
I have to make a decision.
In any case, I'll call you tomorrow.
My TV has quit working.
He earns his living by teaching English.
I know they'll all want to help you.
What do you desire?
The only thing that matters is that you are alive.
Forget I said anything.
Take care and have a nice day.
She accused me of stealing her money.
I gave you fair warning.
Tom was on time.
Dad's in an impatient mood today.
Don't hesitate to call if you need me.
He doesn't have to know.
Why are you worried?
Can you get the door to shut?
I'm not sure what he was thinking.
I'm giving my old books away.
Tom enjoyed the movie.
They'll never make it.
What accounts for the fact that women outlive men?
I know I got it right this time.
I love my work.
Have you seen Tom's medical records?
I can't get her out of my mind.
I don't know.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
Why are you here so early?
Am I on the right road?
They got it.
Tom is an excellent lawyer.
Were you nervous during the job interview?
He was killed in the war.
This is insanity.
I bought a new handbag.
Shut your eyes.
I know exactly where I am.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
We should take a break and have some tea.
This sword has a strange history.
Bite your tongue.
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
I thought we could do better.
Tom asked Mary where she lived.
He did not expect to live so long.
They parted with a firm handshake.
Can I turn off the TV?
My brother is ambidextrous.
Let's be happy.
Tom didn't give it back to me.
I don't like feeling helpless.
Did you accomplish your goals?
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
What do you suppose is in this box?
He might not be happy.
Smoking stinks.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
She is almost as tall as you.
Can you come with me?
I came to see Tom.
Do you want to know who did this?
What have you done to him?
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.
I want to see your boss.
Come to lunch with us.
She pressured him to quit his job.
I could have you arrested.
This is my dog.
I think we've seen this movie before.
A nail punctured the tire.
He can't do that.
Tom asked Mary to brew some coffee.
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
It's raining again.
If you add three to four, you get seven.
I've never tried doing this before.
No one can help you.
He's financially dependent on his wife.
Tom is unable to cope with stress.
He soon accustomed himself to cold weather.
Women in that country are fighting for their freedom.
It's the same every year.
As soon as she wakes up, we'll turn on the music.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
I'd like to rent a car.
They just beat us.
He is bound to pass the entrance examination.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.
My grandmother lives by herself.
Leave me alone or I'll call the police.
I don't know who that man is.
Cookie's mother died of cancer.
It didn't help.
I lit the match.
Let's start by introducing ourselves.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
I hate when that happens.
I'm sure we can work this out.
He knows the city well.
I got fined.
You're foolish.
All things must pass.
I can't agree with you.
She is popular with other girls.
The sky is clear and the sun is bright.
They talked about culture.
You don't need to worry anymore.
I'd rather be here than in Boston.
That's what we're working on.
I still don't know what'll happen tomorrow.
Tom understood exactly what Mary meant.
I'd be honored.
Tom is always joking.
I lit the candle.
Tom knew that Mary loved John.
I wanted to make a few phone calls.
Tom looked out of the window.
It's not my birthday.
I don't know how else to put it.
Where are we going tomorrow?
You're either with me or you're against me.
I knew I should've stayed at home.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
Lend him as much money as he needs.
None of this makes any sense.
Are you going home by bus?
What he said made us angry.
We're busy.
I really don't want to talk about it.
I have no explanation.
Tom doesn't know where he was born.
I think we're pretty lucky.
I can afford neither the time nor the money for a trip.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
There's a convenience store diagonally across the street.
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
If you don't eat breakfast, you'll probably be hungry during the morning and won't be as efficient at work as you could be.
I've promised Tom I would help.
Is this all there is?
It has happened before.
The boys played cops and robbers.
You cannot be serious.
Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?
Let me explain it with a diagram.
We caught you.
I want to file a complaint.
I feel relaxed with you.
He crushed the stone completely.
I think you should go now.
Buses are running at 20 minute intervals.
I could not attend the ceremony.
He is always reading.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
Don't try to talk right now.
I'm sick of being sick.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
I hate being stupid.
I'm not always free on Sundays.
It's considered to be an important matter.
We should not resort to violence.
Tom asked Mary why she was late.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
If anything happens here, can I depend on you?
He can't take care of himself.
Stop arguing.
I'm loyal.
I won't fight you.
Our teachers are highly qualified.
I stayed home all day long reading novels.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
I don't have time to help you with your homework.
Don't spread yourself too thin.
Tom propped his bicycle against the wall.
People ask you for criticism, but they only want praise.
Democracy is one form of government.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
The place was packed.
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
Let's hit the road.
It's already out of fashion.
Why are you so arrogant?
I had lunch with Tom at a restaurant near the office.
I've got plenty of money.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I'll keep you posted.
I only took a bite of bread.
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Tom will be here tonight.
Why do I even care?
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
Are you on dope?
This changes nothing.
Is there anything you want to say?
How long will this take?
Please air the futon.
He decided to rent his property to that company.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
They dealt with the prisoners kindly.
I never thought I'd see her there.
There's no one in your bedroom.
I got lost in the woods.
I have some reading to do.
He worked hard.
You are very insensitive.
Everyone sat down.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
This is how I did it.
Breakfast is ready.
I have to go on a diet to lose weight.
Are we still on for later?
I know Tom is unemployed.
Words failed her.
What he's doing is illegal.
Tom is the only boy who doesn't like football.
You aren't invited.
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on.
You must be joking!
She ordered the book from England.
He won the race again.
It's against my principles.
I bought a good camera.
There was a large audience at yesterday's concert.
What did they hit you with?
Let's do this again. It's been a lot of fun.
I'm just happy to be here.
He found out the secret.
We're unemployed.
Tom can't help me.
We went to the mountains to ski.
Don't hide under the bed.
What are your plans for Christmas?
She is very hardworking.
I felt my heart beating rapidly.
Stay in this room.
I flunked out of school.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Leave out this word.
Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?
Will you dance with me?
The cheesecake tasted too sweet.
I expect much of him.
I can't prove it, but I'm sure he was murdered.
I think you might like it.
Can I talk to you?
I'll think about it.
Tom and Mary told me they had a good time at the concert.
Please leave.
He wasn't exactly a stranger.
I will see him at the first opportunity.
See you tomorrow.
I forgot.
He left the office without saying a word to anyone.
I don't believe in astrology.
He proved to be an ideal husband.
This word comes from Greek.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
Is Tom living in Boston?
I thought I was going crazy.
Tom wanted to become a lawyer.
This tape isn't sticky.
As a matter of fact, she is my sister.
Please answer the phone.
Tom asked Mary when the last time she had bought a book was.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
That's really sad.
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
The juggler wowed the crowd by keeping ten oranges up in the air.
When did you learn how to swim?
Rigor mortis sets in soon after death.
Don't take any prisoners.
This clock gains two minutes a day.
Tom liked what he saw.
It rained hard last night.
What's today's exchange rate?
It's your only shot.
He knows how to drive a car.
That is my overcoat.
She made up her mind to go to college.
How do you even know that?
Cats are like girls. If they talk to you it's great, but if you try to talk to them, it doesn't go so well.
People were watching.
I don't regret that decision.
It's really difficult to describe.
I got one for Christmas.
The tragedy of war must not be forgotten.
The piano is expensive.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
That's a very bad idea.
Don't stick your hand out of the window.
I wouldn't think of it.
We found it here.
Get in the van.
You look pale.
I understood the message.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
He is more lucky than clever.
Tom is hiding.
A fire broke out after the earthquake.
Why did you agree to help them?
I hate this car.
I'm a French citizen.
That has nothing to do with it.
I'm sick of listening to your complaints.
I'm fond of listening to classical music.
Have you got any ideas yet?
The show starts in ten minutes.
You don't look very good.
Can I come over?
How long were you at the party?
Can one of you open the door for me?
The kids will be happy to see you.
It's because of you that I'm an invalid.
Have you ever been there?
He easily licked his opponent.
I'm freezing.
How about a smoke?
I was surprised at the news of his sudden death.
Tom seems to be objective.
Tom is in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before leaving for America.
You've tried.
Open the safe.
I want to keep on living with him.
My new job leaves me little time to socialize.
Get me out of here now.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
Acid eats into metal.
We were playing rugby.
If that doesn't work, try something else.
I figured I might find you here.
Did I mention that?
I no longer love you.
I don't think you have a choice.
I know you've been waiting a long time, but could you wait just a little bit longer?
How far did it go?
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary had sent him.
I feel like I've known you forever.
I thought I recognized you.
Tom corrected himself.
Are you hurt anywhere?
It's an interesting argument.
I thought you'd agree.
You can't get there from here.
Tom was beginning to feel tired.
He speaks really well.
Men never cry.
Thirteen passengers were hospitalized.
That happened over a year ago.
Save yourself.
I want to show you something very special.
I don't know what to do next.
Tom got his head bashed in.
That's a nice coat.
I'm not doing that today.
If you don't want to give a speech, you don't have to.
You said I was beautiful.
If you want quality, pay for it.
I'm really angry.
I saw a stranger enter that house.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I like him.
She has a natural talent for music.
Did you understand me?
We'll never catch Tom.
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
I can't stop watching.
He got what he wanted.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
Shouldn't you go home?
Do you know all these people?
This car is like new.
I totally forgot.
You're the prettiest woman I've ever seen.
Wires carry electricity.
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
Are we all here?
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
Tom will never give up.
The matter is of no importance.
I really have to get this done today.
Could you show me this bag?
The government owed millions of dollars.
Lightning can be dangerous.
What song was Tom singing?
I didn't understand that.
Can you elaborate?
Tom lost the race.
You only really need to sound exactly like a native speaker if you want to become a spy.
Don't stop until I tell you.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Let's not go.
Are you certain?
You can't do both at the same time.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
What is your destination?
I don't have the authority to give you permission.
He didn't like to be punished.
Did you understand any of that?
That's what I need to know.
Let me give you an example.
I accompanied her on a walk.
Don't put the wet towel in the bag.
I leave it up to you.
You were Tom's only friend.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
That was cool.
The radio warned us of the coming earthquake and we started gathering our things.
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school.
Make up your own mind.
I'll be back tonight.
We voted against the bill.
A baseball came flying through the window.
Your suggestion seems reasonable.
I'm volunteering.
He frowns on his wife's wasting money.
The president ignored the protesters outside his office.
You'd better not stay up too late.
I thought you'd ask that.
It is time for her to go home.
Who should I call?
Tom says he feels much better today than yesterday.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
Are they really friends?
Who are you waiting for?
It's redundant.
Would you buy that?
I can tell you things you won't hear from anyone else.
It's something new.
Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
All of a sudden, large drops of rain began falling from the dark sky.
It'll only take a minute.
We went to the beach to swim.
The thief ran away when he saw a policeman.
I asked my mother what to bring there.
He refused to give them the information.
Children filled the room.
He had the kindness to show me the way.
I didn't feel like going out this evening.
Do you play in a band?
You can't go outside.
I have been to London.
Tom is on the go day and night.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
I want to know who did that.
We found something.
Please feel free to ask me questions.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
Why do you despise people?
Make an offer.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Japanese forces marched into Burma.
I think we can handle that.
I need to get some sleep.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
He likes to cook for his family.
The Coliseum was the former arena in ancient Rome.
Where's the red tie I bought you?
It's almost impossible.
I'm planning to disguise myself as a doctor.
I have to pay this bill by Monday.
Tom helped again.
Tom asked me if I was sleepy.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
I just want to help you relax.
That's just crazy.
She didn't have any pencils.
I think Tom is nervous.
You were drunk, weren't you?
The barometer is falling. It is going to rain.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
She's much better today.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
Who is that pretty girl?
I told you I have a girlfriend.
She has a distinct English accent.
I made a list of people I wanted to invite to my party.
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
I can't believe I'm here again.
We got to the station at six.
Where did you find that strange thing?
Tom and Mary raised three children.
He contracted malaria while living in the jungle.
I have a friend who can speak French.
I caught them in the act.
Could you get in touch with him?
Green doesn't go with red.
I think you should stick to your training schedule.
War is evil.
Luck plays an important part in your life.
I think the story is true.
Are you in a bad mood?
She peeked through the curtain.
This is what he painted.
Have you tried this before?
I did the right thing.
Tom has been beaten up pretty badly.
Who is in this room?
I must work tomorrow.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I flunked out of school.
I don't want to regret anything.
Anybody wanna grab something to eat with me?
I was cleaning.
You're the oldest.
There must be some misunderstanding.
I'm not asking your permission.
She is never on time.
Tom and Mary have different philosophies of life.
He's a bigot.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Four people were in the car when the accident happened.
They all changed.
His family didn't have much money.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
Are you dressed?
We're being used.
He looked at me for an explanation.
Are we friends?
Let's not deviate from the subject.
What are you writing?
I like summer the best.
I need to shave.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
I tend to catch colds.
It is good to see you.
They made up an unlikely story.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
This must never happen again.
You're exhausted.
Proper ID is required.
Why did Tom call you?
Why are you so hard-headed?
This is considered to be a matter of great importance.
Concerning this, I'm the one to blame.
There was absolutely no furniture in that room.
Were you at home all morning?
What's in the truck?
Tom shouldn't say things like that to Mary.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
Are you talking to yourself again?
We're going to play tennis.
Pretend you're me.
It is going to rain all night.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
You just made that up, didn't you?
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
Summer is almost here.
Go back to your room.
It's convenient living so close to the station.
She was lying face down on the bed.
Keep away from me.
Can you turn that down?
He will soon be past playing with toys.
My father spends a lot of time on his hobby.
Who can help me?
He cleared the roof of snow.
I need to go.
I have very few books in English.
I should probably not be doing this.
It always happens the same way.
I think we both know why I'm here.
I'll be back by six.
I feel happy.
I finished my lunch quickly.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
Have you ever been kissed?
Tom only listens to heavy metal.
Tom talked to a lot of people.
Take as much time as you want.
He's raking it in.
Isn't there going to be a wedding?
Try this cake.
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
I have no food.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
Take all the time you need.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine, but he felt he needed to.
I saw him scolded by his mother.
Tom has worked for me for three years.
Do you want me to talk to Tom about what's going to happen?
If I create an example, will you correct it for me?
I thought you said Tom needed more time.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
I tried to open the door, but I couldn't because it was locked.
And then, he chased the cattle, the sheep and everyone out of the temple.
I've never lied to you.
We think that he will come.
She's got such lovely eyes.
He will be waiting for her.
Why aren't you listening?
I can take care of that immediately.
Thank you for asking me to do this.
Maybe we should just give up.
I wouldn't care.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
Tom saw something on the ground.
I figured you might change your mind.
You're very pretty.
How long have you been a teacher?
Although our universe is still young, theorists are busy exploring its ultimate fate.
When should we tell Tom?
I want you to admit you were wrong.
Do you like English?
She had a basket full of apples.
They're handcuffed.
I like spending time with her.
I still need to renew my passport.
That will cost thirty euros.
Staying at home is boring.
I learned to live without her.
I'm reluctant to help Tom.
The boy took off his clothes and put on his pajamas.
I bought two cotton shirts.
I'm going to hurt you.
Let's have a look.
Who did this?
Get that dog away from me.
I'd have waited for you.
I just moved.
She came back ten minutes after the explosion.
He seems to be asleep.
You should be more careful.
I like you as a friend.
We had no choice except to put up with it.
Nobody is perfect.
Where are they taking you?
Shut that door.
My eyes get tired very easily.
Frankly speaking, I don't like your haircut.
She has known him since they were very young.
What happened to that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend?
I know Tom is troubled.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
I feel very chilly.
The moon is out.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I'm taking a bath.
I've got a plastic cup.
How did you lose it?
I didn't expect you.
His little sister is very cute, isn't she?
That smells delicious.
I'll bring you something to eat.
Tom's excited.
It's a vague story.
The girls bought him a watch.
Do you think we will get there on time?
His new book met with a favorable reception.
I didn't believe the old man at all.
I prefer not to discuss it here.
Don't put anything on the box.
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
Do you know what time they came?
I arrived too late.
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
Would you like to hear me sing a song?
I thought the ending was perfect.
We accept all major credit cards.
That's just what you needed.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
I made dinner.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
I'll be absent tomorrow.
You don't need to convince me.
If you are not going to the concert, then neither am I.
They're looking for you.
We did it yesterday.
The teacher didn't let the students ask any questions.
The natives saw an airplane then for the first time.
You look perfect.
What can be done?
I have a big problem.
Tell me it's not true.
I like cookies.
I think that's just what I need right now.
You are not Japanese.
I really don't want to be alone tonight.
You needn't have taken a taxi.
It'll be too late then.
Your plan worked.
It was almost funny.
She has buried her only son.
Please give me one of these.
What's this street called?
You are actresses.
I'm so happy that you're here.
He sat next to her.
Be quiet, all of you.
Our new head office is in Tokyo.
I gave a homeless man twenty dollars.
The cat sat on the mat.
The French Revolution took place in 1789.
I am an artist.
I was too astonished to speak.
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
The bottle smashed to pieces.
They asked me for something to drink.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
She looks beautiful in that dress.
Don't you remember anything?
Her beauty is incomparable.
He wanted to know more about the flowers.
I hope you won't tell Tom about this.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
What's the matter with you?
She claims that she knows nothing about him.
We should cancel the hike.
What did I do to deserve this?
Have you tried online dating?
I have never heard him complain.
Must I go on?
Where shall we eat tonight?
Do ants have ears?
They're constructing a bridge over the river.
This is very difficult work.
I wasn't informed.
I do like the way you think.
What do I have to do to convince you?
I thought you might be upset.
How many times a week do you go shopping at a supermarket?
I lost a bunch of keys.
I will telephone you later on.
He went to bed because he was tired.
He entertained us with jokes all evening.
I'm about ready.
Take one of these.
I appreciate your support.
I felt a drop of rain.
Tom tied the canoe to the top of his car.
We should do everything ourselves.
She helped cook lunch.
Have you been listening to me?
I live in Boston.
As soon as they have collected the necessary funds, they can restart their project.
The mere sight of a mosquito makes her sick.
She may be cute, but I don't like her.
It is easy to work in jeans.
Everyone knows what Tom is doing.
Maybe I should have spoken with Tom.
They had their arms around each other.
The manager called an urgent staff meeting.
I really like being with you.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I'd like your permission to use it.
If you need help, just ask.
You speak like your mother.
He'd prefer to go on Friday.
Please help Tom.
You don't have to lie.
I'm getting old.
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
Tell me what you see.
I'm going to wear these shoes on our date tonight.
I read a lot of books last summer.
I'm very upset.
He's eight years old.
Don't waste your time on trifles.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his dog.
Things might've turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I just don't like getting left behind.
You can't be thirty years old.
I lost interest.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
We all felt happy.
It's boring to stay at home.
Today is a perfect day for a picnic.
They spoke briefly.
Is your mother at home?
Right at that instant, the bus stopped.
Negotiations are proceeding very slowly.
That's right, isn't it?
I've never even told my husband.
Perhaps we overlooked something.
Get out of my life!
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
He did not enjoy his lessons.
Why do you always do that to me?
He was the last person to arrive.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
I said I liked it.
They called for an end to the fighting.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
I'm no friend of yours.
I must open the window.
I'm aware of your problem.
To tell the truth, I'm tired of violent movies.
Nobody was home.
I have to remember to mail the letter.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
Father has gone fishing.
We'd be very interested in what you think.
The king always wears a crown.
You owe me thirty bucks.
Reading is one of life's great pleasures.
I have a vivid imagination.
What are you reading?
My sister isn't a good cook, and neither am I.
Who's this hot babe?
I can't believe I'm not getting fired.
Keep trying.
I know he's the one who did it.
It is not my intent to hurt you in any way.
Ask her when she comes back.
Please call him.
She would often play tricks on me.
You're insane.
Do you prefer Coke or Pepsi?
This truck is in need of repair.
Exercise is good for your health.
I am glad to help you.
Can you sing us a song?
When do we arrive?
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
Five plus three is eight.
I live in Hyogo.
Come outside.
I can't believe he kissed you.
I slept through the entire movie.
What vegetables do you usually grow?
I will wait.
I found that fascinating.
Don't be so negative.
Can you walk on stilts?
Is there anything you want me to buy for you?
I wouldn't do that without you.
He died a sad death.
Please take my advice.
Tom certainly knows a lot of French.
How much is the admission?
Do you like trips?
Who does this book belong to?
Why would I want to go there alone?
Stop being so nice to me.
I just want to ask you a question.
Please freeze the fish and meat.
Write a poem with four three-line stanzas.
You look so handsome.
Do you have any foreign books?
Could you tell me what time it is?
Many American planes were shot down.
May I ask a couple of questions?
May I go to the bathroom?
Why do you need a doctor?
Do you speak Chinese well?
Can you make me a snack?
I've got to speak to you.
Bread is made from wheat.
Let's go back to the motel.
Which of these rackets is yours?
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry.
You'll find out soon enough.
Did you have any trouble?
I'm going back to college.
What have I done with my keys?
I suggest we hurry.
Give me two minutes.
We painted the house green.
Out of sight, out of mind.
We're all in the same boat.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
It's no longer available.
Our school was founded in 1990.
I'm just trying to survive.
Tom stopped the engine.
I saw him crossing the road.
Did you show it to your parents?
She had the decency to apologize.
It's not evening yet.
I almost didn't sing that song tonight.
I'm sorry, I just wanted to help.
You're tough.
Tom knows he did something wrong.
Your dress is already out of fashion.
I didn't like beer at that time.
The man was a fountain of knowledge.
I have to eat, too.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
We've already talked about this.
How does this work?
That might depend on your point of view.
Tom is thinking about getting married.
Tom left some dirty dishes in the sink­.
It's your turn to wash the dishes.
You're drunk.
The coffeepot is boiling.
I don't know how to describe it.
I go to the barber's once a month.
Tom swims very fast.
Tom eventually confessed.
He refused my friend request.
Do you mind if I come in?
May I borrow your car?
Can you verify that?
He came running.
Thanks in advance.
I have a throbbing pain here.
I'm at Tokyo Station now.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
That's really cute.
You're taking advantage of her weakness.
I lost my way in the forest.
She attempted to kill herself.
The post office is to the right.
You've been there before, haven't you?
It's not without risks.
I couldn't let you do that.
After three hours in the casino, he's $2,000 in the hole.
Will you turn on the TV?
The tornado destroyed the whole village.
Did I give you the tickets?
I have to know now.
May I go?
I just can't get it right.
We'll go jogging in the park.
I am married and have two children.
Do you hear any sound?
I'm not tired.
Kamal hasn't read the book yet.
Nothing's going to happen.
He stayed home from school because he wasn't feeling well.
I want to see if I can do that.
That's a waste of time and money.
When's dinner served?
Promise me you won't to do anything stupid.
Could I get you to update this data for me?
Do you recognize that woman?
I appreciate you being here.
Tom refused to take part in the game.
I'd better call you back.
I'd rather stay home if it's all the same to you.
In June, it rains day after day.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
I really want to kiss you.
It'd be easy to do that.
It makes me feel dirty.
I had to stay.
I can take a message.
Grab as much as you need.
How long do you study English every day?
I'm not worried about them.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
I have to brush my teeth.
I think you'd better leave now.
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.
I've gone to Kyoto twice.
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto.
You're going to have to pay for the repair.
That's not our only problem.
It's very humid.
You're my type.
Throw me the ball.
I thought you wouldn't give up.
He turned over the business to his son.
We arrived at the airport three hours before our flight.
He does nothing but watch TV all day long.
It's true that he saw a monster.
You like olives, don't you?
Please don't leave me here by myself.
You didn't have to say yes.
Why are your eyes so big?
Do you want me to lose my job?
I don't know that word.
It was pretty shocking.
Are you over your cold yet?
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
I got you all right where I want you.
I'm doing pretty well.
Soon, it won't be unheard of to live to 150.
I kind of hope it doesn't rain.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
Leave that box where it is.
I'm staying over at my friend's place.
Are you still sick?
François has a good idea.
Will you have dinner with me?
You've taught us a great deal.
I saw you.
The fire started in Tom's room.
I hope to return soon.
Are you alone?
Aren't you sleepy?
Is there any chance of my borrowing your typewriter?
You could've told me.
I often play tennis after school.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
The soldiers are wearing iron helmets.
Right now they're all sleeping.
You seem to know everything about this.
Have a nice trip!
It's later than you think.
I found her cat in an empty room.
He bored us with his long stories.
You seem a little depressed.
Just don't drop it.
It is high time you spilled the beans.
Do you wash your hands before meals?
Why didn't you listen to me?
That sounded like a gunshot.
That was a month ago.
How high is Mt. Fuji?
There was nothing left to do.
A good citizen obeys the laws.
Are you happy?
Who will take care of the baby?
I'm the only one who can do that.
Father suddenly got sick and we sent for a doctor.
Don't dismiss any possibility.
I think you might be overreacting.
This is your chance.
I want to make you happy.
I've almost finished listening to the album.
How much for half a kilo?
What do you think of this tie?
The war was finally brought to a close.
Could you open this jar for me?
I just found out about it.
I'm surprised Tom doesn't know how to sing at least one song in French.
Your work has greatly improved.
If it snows on the mountain, it is cold in the valley.
Tom vanished without a trace.
The girl let the bird go.
He was scared you would shoot him.
He was ashamed of having done such a thing.
I like the way this flower smells.
It'll be different now.
I missed you.
Are we done here?
You must meet with her.
She was a pioneer in this field.
Dinner is almost ready.
It is time to go to school.
Tom used to be a soldier.
It's all your own fault.
That's another matter.
You need a license to drive a car.
We became Americanized after World War II.
It was a difficult year for us.
Furry rabbits are so cute.
You should follow his advice.
That's what I want to understand.
I don't even know where.
You are beautiful.
We've been invited to a costume party.
I can hear a cat scratching at the window.
The accident happened the day before yesterday.
I am looking for a present for my mother.
In case I am late, you don't have to wait for me.
You're very sophisticated.
The tree was struck by lightning.
I want you to listen to this song.
Don't worry about others.
You can trust us.
Stand aside.
I can't eat that much food by myself.
Which is the most difficult language in the world?
You're probably too young to understand why we have to do this.
Tom has constructive ideas.
Are you here voluntarily?
I feel like I know you already.
Just don't break anything.
He went to New York as soon as he got the letter.
I just want to help.
I want you to be my partner.
You lost, didn't you?
You don't need to hurry. Take your time.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
I stopped smoking.
She was homesick.
He disagrees with his relatives.
I've already filed my report.
I need the keys.
It's dishonest.
Where's Tom's card?
I weigh about 60 kilos.
Do you know why?
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
He is not much of an artist.
I couldn't let you take all the blame.
I'm not deaf.
The storm didn't cause any damage.
This book has a lot of pictures.
Is there something wrong with me?
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
I found the subject fascinating.
What is your registration number?
He is walking towards the station.
You're very brave.
This theory is too difficult for me to comprehend.
I missed the bus by three minutes.
He's not young anymore.
I am sure of his success.
Old habits are hard to break.
Keep the child away from the pond.
Stay away from him!
I never thought you really did that.
It was a great blow to us.
He betrayed my confidence.
I really hurried.
I didn't say you were here.
What did you think I was going to do?
You're sick!
Don't blame the victim.
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
Tom's eating.
I just want to be different.
That's not what I was doing.
Finally, I finished a painting.
I know your mother.
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
I'd like to buy a new car.
You have a lot of books.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Don't use too much glue.
Tom doesn't know what to buy Mary for her birthday.
I'm out of gas.
The population of London is much greater than that of any other British city.
I already did that.
There is no reason why I shouldn't do it.
I want to earn a lot of money.
They ate and drank wine.
You have to live with it.
Everyone got something for Christmas.
She's unconscious.
It turned out that the cards were stacked against her from the beginning of the game.
What I really want is something hot to eat.
Tom was apparently murdered while he was sleeping.
You cheated.
Why are you making me do this?
I want to sing a song.
I had been studying music in Boston before I returned to Japan.
It looks really good.
Tom pushed his nose against the window.
My father came home at nine.
My brother likes to collect stamps.
I thought you were working.
Between 1820 and 1973, the United States admitted more than 46 million immigrants.
Negotiations are still going on.
Do you think we'll be able to do this without any help?
I hate mosquitoes.
It's ours.
She is too young to know the truth.
You know I'm wrong.
Are you relaxed?
This key won't go in the lock.
We should probably go.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
A hammer was used to break the window.
Are you finished?
I'm still not used to getting up so early.
He was in America at that time.
Mary stayed up late last night.
How does she do it?
Why would you do that without telling us?
She had good reason to file for a divorce.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
Tom will be in charge while I'm away.
Is your wife tall?
Cats are smarter than you think.
It was a weird feeling.
It's obvious that you're wrong.
We have a job to do.
Feel free to call me if you need anything.
You'd better go.
We're going back.
Tom said he didn't know Mary's address.
The accused was sentenced to death.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
Please drive safely.
I doubt that.
How should I know where he is?
You could go back to Boston if you wanted to.
Will six o'clock suit you?
Just a second. This call might be important.
I'm very thirsty.
Mankind will succeed in using nuclear energy peacefully.
Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't.
I'm meeting someone for dinner.
America was discovered by Columbus in 1492.
How is your cold?
I think they like you.
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
You're Tom's friend, aren't you?
I thought you wanted a divorce.
She is no less charming than her older sister.
There's one thing I must tell you.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Where did you go for spring break?
Have you done all your homework?
She married him only because her parents made her.
We talked about it all night.
Let's take a group picture.
Why don't you repaint your house?
I want this to be over.
I work different hours every day.
There is an album on the shelf.
It is threatening to rain.
Let me make plain what I mean.
Are you going to warn Tom?
I'm sorry for being late.
You've been cleared of all charges.
Do you want help with that?
He attributes his poverty to bad luck.
How did you burn your hand?
Judging from the look of the sky, we might have a shower before nightfall.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
He had a bitter experience.
I don't have that information.
I think you would like it here.
I am an English teacher.
Of course I will go.
Have you already settled the bill?
It's yours if you want it.
Not everybody is the same.
We all got scared.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
We heard the door shut.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in a hurry.
Don't be ridiculous.
At what time is dinner served?
I don't know exactly how or why that happened.
I have Tom's key.
Cats are nocturnal animals.
Tom can't be over thirty. He looks like he's about eighteen.
You're the one that went crazy.
How deep is the lake?
She gave me a watch.
Where are the kids?
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Tom has enough money to buy any computer in this store. He just needs to decide which one.
Even the hard-hearted can be moved to tears.
I'll see you in October.
Are you a psychologist?
Tom thinks Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
It's all your fault.
Is everything okay?
The cops won't find you there.
Tom doesn't think before he speaks.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
My father will soon be forty years old.
He lied to my face.
When I was a child, I was always drinking milk.
I seem to have a temperature.
I was glad to help.
It was not until yesterday that we noticed the animal missing.
A trip to Hawaii will cost you about 200 dollars.
He came late, as is often the case with him.
A guard's been killed.
Tom imitated Mary.
I wonder whether Tom is really serious.
He hated lying.
The room is spacious and light.
It's almost six.
She rode a camel.
I had a wonderful time.
Tom was stabbed in the chest.
No one made you do anything.
We study music.
Here's your pudding.
Do you work here?
I've never played the tuba.
Would you step aside?
Finish this.
Tom has been behaving weirdly.
I'm sick of hearing the same thing all the time.
She was fluent in French.
Who's Tom afraid of?
Let me sleep.
He did well for a beginner.
Who's that?
I had things to do.
Please be serious.
You had better not do that.
I'm open to suggestions.
I can't tell you everything.
Can we go?
Tom's father is a swimming teacher.
She knows a lot about the latest fashions.
He had his head in the clouds in class.
I need something for a child.
Do you think I want to die?
Tom began to dance.
Is that important?
Did you invite him?
You're not going to want to miss this.
This bicycle belongs to me.
Please be quiet, everybody.
I am very glad to meet you today.
Are you sure about that?
The horse stopped and wouldn't move.
On behalf of the company, I would like to express our hearty thanks to you all.
If you want to succeed, use your time well.
The dog bit the man.
I didn't get discouraged.
Can you sell the book to me for 500 yen?
It happened so quickly.
Her eyes were red from crying.
Fill it up.
He has a Toyota.
Let's look on the positive side.
I don't know how we did it.
I want you to beg for mercy.
The children were swimming naked.
He had never seen such a bad boy.
There you are.
How old is the oldest person you know?
I wish I could live in a house that nice.
It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
I went to his house at 3 o'clock, but he was out.
Glad to see you, Tom.
This does not bode well.
The suspect wanted to avoid being arrested.
Let's check the map.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
Let's take advantage of the vacation to go on a hike.
Why are you interested?
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
The concert was awful.
The two poems express human suffering.
They made Tom an offer.
I know what they are.
I had no control over the situation.
You'd better start at once.
Now shake hands and make up.
I wanted to impress you.
Is it too late to get my money back?
I miss my cat.
I asked him to make tea.
We want to take your blood pressure.
Get on your horse.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
How many days are there in a week?
I just dropped in to say goodbye.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
He has a big restaurant near the lake.
What happens if that happens?
I've been working.
He is not in.
I want to apologize to everybody.
Tom shut the kitchen door.
I've been trying to make an effort to come here more often.
I'm not lying.
We're moving next month.
Take as many cookies as you want.
You recognize her, don't you?
The brothers hate each other.
I only got your letter yesterday.
They supplied the soldiers with enough food and water.
There are no food stores in the immediate area.
I was told that it's dangerous to swim here.
This is painful.
I had some work that needed finishing.
How are we going to pay for that?
Say hello to your father for me.
All you have to do is study harder.
That is a boat.
You don't think I can do it, do you?
I thought you had somewhere else to be.
Don't make a sound.
They weren't invited.
You don't keep your promises.
Beethoven was a great musician.
What you did was wrong.
Give me some time to let it all sink in.
We heard tigers roaring in the distance.
It's urgent.
A company that stifles innovation can't hope to grow very much.
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Eat whatever you like.
Are you proud of yourself?
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
What is done cannot be undone.
You can't kill both of us.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
Which team is ours?
I thought he was honest.
I still wonder why Tom did that.
I got an email yesterday that was written in French.
I need to be prepared.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
Tom is going to have to ask Mary to help him.
We're bored.
This is the perfect place.
He can help you out.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
That's nice to know.
I guess that's what I'll do.
A large amount of money was spent on the new bridge.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
When I saw Tom yesterday, he was wearing a cowboy hat.
Are you sick? You look pale.
The rent is due tomorrow.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
She gave me a pretty doll.
Tom snores.
All of them agreed to the proposal.
What a blessing!
I'd like to give you the key, but I can't.
Why don't you go help Tom?
I just want to live a normal life.
Nothing has changed.
It was sweet of you to do this for us.
Did you study by yourself?
Will you try this on for me?
He is the father of three children.
I don't understand this reasoning.
I felt sad.
What is the emergency?
I couldn't lie to you.
Do you think there's a connection?
Why don't you and I continue this discussion in private?
I'm afraid of flying.
We saw a funny movie last Sunday.
He studied the flight of birds.
Don't speak to him like that.
I like light colors.
I slept through the storm.
It was a forced smile.
You must get rid of that bad habit.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
As a rule, I prefer people who deal with matters of this kind directly with those involved.
I'd like to change my room.
Some of the roses in my garden are white, and the others are red.
He was educated by her grandfather.
You gotta get more organized.
I should have talked to you first about it.
They have enough money.
This is classified.
A lot of students around the world are studying English.
Lead the way.
I'm not sure I like this.
He shook hands with me.
They'll tell you the truth.
I'm just a little bored.
I know how busy you are.
What time do you think he'll come back?
Let's talk about solar energy.
You came at just the right time.
I watch television all day long.
Why didn't the police notify us?
He turned Christian.
It looks like no one's home.
I can't take this any longer.
Did I give it to you?
You probably already know about our company.
We discussed the problem at length.
He has no equal in the field of electronics.
His sweater is gray.
I know whether or not he is an enemy.
You’ll see that I’m right.
The old man looks sad.
Tom is my friend.
Have you heard this story already?
I'm definitely going crazy.
I'm going to protect you, Tom.
There is no dress code.
I am too tired to keep on walking.
I was surprised by his perseverance.
Is everyone waiting?
He is a student at Yushu High School.
You need to lose weight.
This will protect your skin.
My favorite color is blue.
Do you have a dog?
As soon as she met him, she burst into tears.
We're done.
I finished the job yesterday.
We're here to help.
None of us saw it.
I'm going to do it first thing tomorrow.
Are you done with the paper?
Driving too fast is dangerous.
I knew this would happen.
It was shorter than she expected.
A great crowd waited for the president to speak.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
Are you here to help us?
I think that would be nice.
That job bores me to death.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
He is such a show off.
I know you're richer than me.
The dogs started barking.
I'm looking forward to seeing him.
Tie your shoe.
They found us.
I'm fairly happy.
Those men are cowards.
It's too dark to play tennis now.
Lie still.
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
I am accustomed to living alone.
I was to have finished the work yesterday.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
I'll choke the life out of him.
I apologize if I offended you.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
I was in a better mood three hours ago.
The cops want you.
Are all these books yours?
How much oil is spilled into the ocean every year?
Tom joined our group.
An important function of policemen is to catch thieves.
They seldom, if ever, speak in French.
You really are good.
Who helps her?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
Tom doesn't eat between meals.
I didn't sleep much last night.
Please remember to turn off the light before going to bed.
My hair is greasy.
What is he like?
Do you know your blood type?
Today is September 1st.
Are we going to do that?
A careful reader would have noticed the mistake.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Blood was everywhere.
She advised him to come back at once.
I'm not as afraid of heights as I used to be.
We're waiting for you to leave.
A car that you never took out of the garage would be of no value to you.
The diamond was set in a gold ring.
Don't drink any alcohol.
He said, "It's nine o'clock."
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night.
I'll never forgive you.
I suppose you want to use my office.
You're the one that went crazy.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
What was her answer to your proposal?
Roll up your sleeves and get to work.
I haven't written for a long time.
He refused to pay.
I am convinced of your innocence.
During the rush hours in Tokyo, traffic is heavy.
Good luck on the test!
Could you call me back a bit later?
He suggested that we take a short rest.
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
I made muffins.
All I want now is a glass of water.
I want to show you something I've been working on.
Adjust the microscope's focus.
Tell me where you got this.
I persuaded him to give up the idea.
The outcome depends entirely on your own efforts.
She stared him in the face.
You can sleep on the couch.
He runs in the park every day.
My wife was mad.
Will you entertain the guests while I get dressed?
He did the reverse of what I asked.
He should have worked harder.
This is not necessary.
We managed to get there on time.
Mary felt happy when she learned the results of the election.
Tom has a lot of pictures of Mary.
You ought to thank him.
Tom teaches his friends French.
I can't do this anymore.
You were jealous, weren't you?
She's maxed out all her credit cards.
Buy me a drink.
Is the job too much for you?
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
They want more.
I was a student at that time.
I think about Tom often.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
I can't imagine my life without you.
We need to cut costs.
I want a quart of milk.
When did he go?
Put your pants on.
Everyone looks worried.
He is quite right.
Hello, how are you?
Why are you asking so many questions?
It's a questionable policy.
We wish him all the best of luck in his future endeavors.
How many times have you done that?
That's just common sense.
Don't ask me to do this.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
That store sells newspapers and magazines.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
He follows the rules to the letter.
You don't look your age.
I think I'll be busy this week.
You're the tallest person here.
Could you please tell me again why you are late?
Be nicer to your sister.
Tom said he enjoyed the show.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
Do you know a good restaurant?
They all knew.
They missed the deadline.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
Do you plan to go abroad?
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
Don't make me use this gun.
The two of them were never to meet again.
She wanted him to say that he would pay the bill.
Did you check this?
Please sit still.
Did I make the team?
I told you everything I knew.
You're not as good as you think you are.
I just want to be alone.
I had things I had to deal with.
He swims better than I do.
You're so impatient with me.
When did you get back from Boston?
Throw them overboard.
I haven't washed my hair.
My car isn't for sale.
Does your wife know?
They'll have to wait.
A toothache deprived me of sleep.
What time shall I pick you up?
Tom told them not to do that.
This should be plenty.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
It turned out to be true.
I cried when Tom told me about that.
Was that you I heard singing in the shower?
They'll be so happy to have Tom back.
I'm no friend of yours.
I felt bad, so I was admitted into the hospital. However, it turned out that there was nothing really wrong with me.
Move up to the front, please.
I'm afraid I took the wrong train.
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
You can't just not pay someone for work you hired them to do.
Sheep eat grass.
I'd like to dance.
We should have taken the schedule into consideration.
She met her uncle.
I wish to speak to Tom.
Tom took another sip.
You're double-parked.
Maybe I should go with you.
They were born in Thailand.
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor.
How do you spend your time?
I don't know what you're waiting for.
No one will care.
I'm not good at French.
He ran as fast as he could.
Turn the flame down low.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Where did you see the boy?
Do you want to play tennis with us?
Look where you are going.
What are your intentions?
We were playing chess.
Tom is aggressive.
I don't eat out very often.
The hotel is on fire.
Don't you see what you've become?
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
We must be cautious.
You keep out of this.
Tom should've been home on Monday.
Tom woke the children up and told them to get ready for school.
I've always wanted to learn French.
Tom and Mary flew to Boston.
This is insoluble in water.
Don't fall into her trap.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
What's going to happen?
I just got back three hours ago.
To tell the truth, I didn't go there.
Sit up straight.
Tom liked what he saw.
I don't think anybody can help me now.
My father slept through the movie.
Are you a singer?
I didn't ask you to do that.
We almost froze to death.
He drinks to excess.
Be still.
I could hear everything.
Do you plan to buy that car?
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
Can I drive the tractor?
I wasn't really in the mood to go out.
Do not throw anything out of the window.
It's clean.
How far is it from here to the park?
Tom is very proud of what he's been able to accomplish.
It's really big.
I agree with you completely.
Did you wash that?
I will think of something.
Let's paint the town red.
Where do you come from?
You cannot take back what you have said.
Did you volunteer us?
Will you be hiring any part-time help?
Would you like to come over for dinner?
Tom is watching golf.
I'm more than a friend.
It was just a thought.
My father may be sleeping.
I've got a pacemaker.
I always wanted to be a teacher.
What is the matter with you?
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
He could not answer that question.
I'll beat you up!
His name was forgotten.
Our success was due in part to good luck.
How much did you have to pay for the tickets?
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early.
Please help me take this lid off.
The road curves gently towards the west.
You're finicky.
A cat was sleeping in the bass drum.
Who did you meet there?
Be quiet for a moment.
Their teacher praised them.
What did Tom order?
They arranged a meeting.
You look very tired.
I was pleasantly surprised.
There was a discussion on the measures.
I need to borrow your car.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
Whatever you say.
I'm still in shape.
A poet looks at the world as a man looks at a woman.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
Are you in a lot of pain?
After ten years as business partners, they decided to part ways.
Don't cry over spilt milk.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
We will survive.
You're sure about this, right?
You're fashionable.
Glaciers around the world are melting.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I've seen it a million times.
You won't bleed to death.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
My room has two windows.
Would you like me to massage your shoulders?
Does that mean you'll stay?
I want your love.
She waved at me before she got on board the plane.
Have you ever fixed your car by yourself?
Do you know this place well?
You don't really mean it, do you?
I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
Do I annoy you?
It was a fine day, so we went swimming.
Go ahead and take one.
He turned off the light.
What's going to happen?
It's back to square one.
Why didn't you shave?
Bodybuilding is his hobby so he has a very firm tight body with lots of muscle definition.
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
You need to call Tom immediately.
He seems to be rich now.
You shouldn't have borrowed Tom's car.
Just take mine.
We're getting there.
We'll be there.
From personal experience, I know that any encounter with him will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
I've never seen my cat act like that.
Don't be sad.
She plays Bach.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
You're very timid.
Does that mean you bought it?
Fix this.
I'm finished with you.
Have you learned the poem by heart?
They lost.
Since when do you have a problem with the death penalty?
You did this.
We are going to the shop.
Do you have the painting?
If I had enough money, I could do that.
We went too far.
Call the police!
That street is very noisy.
He doesn't speak my language.
This invention will make you very rich.
Can you call me a taxi?
I gave him a few books.
I think it's a fair decision.
You got what you wanted, didn't you?
Tom will stay with us.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
You're not a loser.
That's all we needed.
Why did God create the universe?
This paper is white.
Wait a little longer.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Tom and Mary both left the room at the same time.
I think you're right.
What time do you want me to pick you up?
I was unable to prevent this.
What's the time now?
You may still be in luck.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
A cold wind was blowing on his face.
He's out now.
I didn't need to tell him.
I sat down next to him.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
A husband and wife promise always to love each other.
Your fly is open!
Men and women need each other.
I can't promise you anything.
We'll be eating soon.
I have many dreams.
Leave the book where it was.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
I nailed it.
I'm the guy who gave Tom that hat.
We're all cowards.
How can I get to the zoo from here?
Tom won't talk to me about it.
I want to find out who broke the window.
Which road should I take?
How was your night?
What time do you think Tom will get home?
I will visit you tomorrow without fail.
I wish we could have met under better circumstances.
You seem a little nervous.
You're very curious.
Eat whatever you like.
I think Tom probably doesn't like you very much.
From this point, we'll go on by car.
Are you enjoying this?
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
Tom is a bit paranoid.
Cuff him.
Do penguins live at the North Pole?
Thank you for helping me reach my goals.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
I beat him at chess.
I've been asked to quit the company.
Do you know how to unlock this door?
I eat everything.
We have families we have to take care of.
She assumed an air of indifference.
This question is not easy.
He made me carry his baggage.
Tom took a couple of steps back.
I know what it's like to be alone.
I wasn't even there.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
We left early in the morning.
These scissors are suitable for left and right-handed people.
You look just like your mother.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
The decision hasn't yet been made.
That's clear.
That's it. I've done everything I can.
The hostages will be released.
There are only three girls in the class.
Whether rains or not, the game is going to be held.
Why does he become drowsy whenever he begins to study?
I want a box three times as large as this.
She is connected with that company.
Is he your teacher?
When my mom finds out, she won't be happy.
Why don't you go help Tom?
She spent all afternoon cooking.
Were you even tempted?
You're too slow.
I'm here if you need anything.
We got ready.
May I go with him?
I'm not going to school today.
I figured I might find you here.
I need an extra blanket.
Novels aren't being read as much as they used to be.
He likes me.
I need to talk to you now.
He said that he had told you to speak more slowly.
I told you it didn't work.
I've completely forgotten his name.
Their patience was about to give out.
We must start at once.
You don't know what this means to us.
I'd accept.
He lost his new watch.
The plane increased speed.
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
You might want some of this.
That's not funny at all anymore.
The gate was left open.
That's no excuse.
You have to go.
She is always kind to everyone.
He's good at cards.
What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
I played tennis with Tom.
I've been following you.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
Do you think parents should punish their children when they lie?
He fell and hurt his leg.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over.
I'll be in my car.
What've you been doing today?
Tom hasn't called.
There are fifteen people here, counting the guests.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I'll have what he's having.
They hated each other.
You're all hypocritical.
Nobody is paying attention to Tom.
Do you have a red pencil?
I have no idea of what to expect.
He's swimming now.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
He slipped on the ice.
What we have is one thing and what we are is quite another.
Why do you always want to do things the hard way?
I am through with my work.
There was no emergency.
You can't be too careful.
I can't risk that.
Don't climb up the wall.
I've got Tom's address somewhere on my computer.
I want to send this letter to Japan.
Are you retarded or something?
He has a good appetite.
Can you help me write a love letter?
Did I say something stupid?
What do you see?
Why don't you take a closer look?
Hold still a moment while I fix your tie.
Does Tom know Mary is here?
We all have missed you.
Lets play video games or something.
Please be sure to turn off the light before you leave.
Don't ask so many questions.
Let's build something.
Tom was born in the nineties.
I don't have time for a walk.
I didn't fall in love.
The police took some pictures of the scene of the accident.
I was given a medal.
It's simple and intuitive.
What are you saving up for?
I've come here to help you.
She found the key to my heart.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
I ended up winning.
Smoking is harmful to the health.
I've made this trip a thousand times.
I didn't realize you were hungry.
That's not funny.
Where is the Greek embassy?
What can I get you?
He said it as a joke.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
We'll manage.
The house collapsed a week later.
The girl's eyes were filled with tears.
We didn't give them a choice.
He just loves to bully people.
I was afraid of catching a cold.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
It's time-consuming.
He called me a taxi.
Make this sentence a little shorter.
My father is oblivious to the emotional pain his abuse caused me.
Here's your drink.
The concert was incredible.
Ask her what her name is.
She can tell the most outrageous lie without batting an eye.
I would like you to introduce me to her.
What's your name again?
You've been selected.
I thought you wouldn't tell her that we hadn't done our homework.
Let me put this in perspective for you.
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
He has two daughters.
He didn't see the stop sign and almost hit the child crossing the street.
He's not sure he wants to do this.
I didn't think you were needed.
Close the window.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
He is capable of treachery.
That's very funny.
I can't eat any more.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
He hung his head sheepishly.
I appreciate the support.
Well, have you decided?
I found this book interesting from start to finish.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Insurance policies don't cover preexisting conditions.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Could you turn it down?
Answer the phone, please.
My father took out his wallet and gave me ten dollars.
Their teacher praised them.
What did you say your name was?
I don't know many French songs.
I do remember.
You won't regret this. I promise.
I remember it well.
It's dangerous to jump off a moving train.
I'm happy you liked it.
Where did you learn this?
Why should Tom sing that song?
I always walk.
Did you agree to do it?
I think he's happy.
He went backstage after the show.
Are you jealous?
Tom was proud of you.
Make yourself comfortable.
He quietly knocked at the door.
Were you conscientious?
Luckily, I won first prize.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
We're going west.
It's not always like that.
I don't like his rude manner.
I cannot read French.
Have you ever visited Rome?
Tom and Mary weren't religious at all.
How lucky you are!
I didn't want to bug you.
He was scared to admit that he didn't know.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
It's a little dated.
That game was awesome.
When he finds out, he won't be happy.
Cesar Chavez was born on a small farm near Yuma, Arizona in 1927.
Can you speak more than three languages?
I can't sleep because of the noise.
She asked him to give her some money.
Do you want something?
He heard a noise.
This experience will be invaluable as a way of improving the way I study English.
How would you like it if I hit you?
I can't thank you enough.
The store is close to my house.
Buy it for me, please.
I bet you're right.
He's not afraid of anyone.
You get out only what you put in.
That's free.
He lives somewhere around here.
I probably shouldn't have done that.
I agreed with Tom.
Let's sing some English songs together.
I realize I'm just stating the obvious.
Our priorities are wrong.
It's not a fair fight.
They know who he is.
What will they do to us?
She asked him out on a date.
Tom stutters.
Tom told a joke, but nobody laughed.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
I don't even want to know.
We mean you no harm.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I'll never forget our first date.
What did you get hit with?
Do you know her father?
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
Sorry to trouble you.
I feel your pain.
Where can I pick up my airplane ticket?
I didn't know that would happen.
I must learn French.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Tell me it's not true.
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I know you've been trying to help.
This work doesn't pay.
He wants to learn to swim.
I've decided to go a little further.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
We're friends from way back.
My cat eats like a horse.
I think our luck just ran out.
He did it not once, but twice.
I want to ask you a question.
Get a job.
I'm no different.
Come off it!
They made fun of Mary.
They said you were fired.
My parents send you their best regards.
Turn the volume up.
I don't take needless risks.
Your theory has no scientific basis.
Tom doesn't need me.
You're particular.
Tom lives in a poor neighborhood.
My pencil fell off the edge of my desk.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
They said they would not fight.
You know I have no choice, don't you?
I asked him many questions about ecology.
Where can I get a ticket?
I think exams ruin education.
Belgium is not as big as France.
Will you turn on the television?
I'll call you after lunch.
I finally understand the basic principles of calculus.
She broke into tears.
Why don't you take a nap?
Which meat dishes do you propose?
That's a depressing story.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
Where were the police?
You must have forgotten them at the office.
Deposit your money in the bank.
We are moving next month.
The general inspected the troops.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
The bus stopped in every village.
Why did he run away?
I'll get you a glass of water.
I am the first musician in my family.
Please play something by Chopin for me.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Where's the station?
We have more important things to discuss.
We didn't have time to see Tom.
He just texted me.
This is what'll happen.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
I've never been to Istanbul.
Tell them who you are.
You had plenty of opportunity.
Did you say 30?
I'd like to try out this new model before I buy it.
I've received it too.
I told Tom I loved him.
Control yourself.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
I'm free.
It's really cool here.
Where are your kids?
He was deaf, too.
Don't be late.
I study Chinese in Beijing.
What did you say? Could you please say it again?
I'm not that crazy.
Look at this.
I have no time to write to her.
I went straight to bed.
Don't say that word.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Educational reforms still have a long way to go.
He seems like a respectable businessman, but he's really part of the Mafia.
Let's not think about it anymore.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
Stop being so nice.
I'm going downtown.
They spoke briefly.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
I believe he is competent.
Are you sure that's safe?
Maybe there's a better way to do this.
That's the one.
You're not that interesting.
I've known her since I was little.
Nobody's going to rescue you.
Try to control yourself.
Tom didn't scream.
Who stayed?
Tom should stay where he is.
Repetition helps you remember something.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
Tell Tom I'll be back.
I want to eat Korean food.
He's raking it in.
He bought a dress for her.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
There is not much doubt about the cause of the fire.
The ceremony will take place tomorrow.
Don't forget to mail this letter on your way to school.
I was heavily sedated.
Tom asked Mary why she was so late.
I had a cat named Cookie.
Would you mind leaving? I'd like to dress.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
Is that what you really want to do?
Do you know how to count to ten in French?
The flimsy stalls in this restroom offer very little privacy.
What time does that play start?
Bring the water to a boil.
Why is this knife not in the drawer?
Move back a little.
Have you been listening to me?
She seemed uninterested.
You must quit drinking.
They were in the right place at the right time.
I've been all over.
You're my kid's teacher.
He attends the same school that I do.
I didn't understand the meaning.
She read the article over and over again.
My high school French teacher wasn't a native speaker.
They do not waste anything nor throw anything away.
I need an assistant who speaks French.
I know what to expect.
I did my job.
Stand up straight.
Batteries are not included.
He likes to travel. I do, too.
I don't blame you for hitting him.
I'll give him a pen.
Did you know that in Japan, if you have a tattoo, you won't be allowed to bathe in many of the hot spring resorts?
She can't control her children.
You don't look your age.
I'm not supposed to drink.
Safety is not guaranteed.
Are you tired of living?
It's not raining yet.
The friend who I thought would pass the exam failed it.
I don't belong here.
One way to lower the number of errors in the Tatoeba Corpus would be to encourage people to only translate into their native languages.
The girls giggled.
What are you watching?
Please write down your contact address here.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
Don't worry about making mistakes.
That's troubling.
I'm studying very hard.
Will you be hiring any part-time help?
I am going to make him a serious offer.
Thank you for your kindness.
What's it all mean?
What's your real purpose?
Who are you going to vote for?
I can hear you.
Mary went on a voyage around the world.
Tom regrets what he did.
Does the story have a happy ending?
I gave her her dictionary back.
He died of a heart attack on the stage.
You need to be more patient.
What exactly do you plan to do?
There wasn't much else we could do.
My plan was adopted by them.
Thanks for your quick reply.
Are you ready now?
He proofread my manuscript.
I like spring better than fall.
I can't make that kind of promise.
Look at that house.
I'm the youngest one here.
I didn't know what to do first.
I'd like to buy half a cake.
You're very religious, aren't you?
They crashed.
You should do it.
What if I told you I really want to be a teacher?
Fluency in English is a very marketable skill today.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
I've made a mistake, haven't I?
I made a sandwich for you.
I can't believe he kissed you.
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
Tom is probably with Mary.
I didn't try to kill anybody.
Get me some coffee.
Where did you go?
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
I have very good eyesight.
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
You're old enough to know better.
I like your city.
Their way of thinking is behind the times.
Look what I found in the garden.
It was really interesting.
I do want to see you.
Tom is hoping we'll do that.
May I begin?
I had a good night's sleep.
Can you make the deadline?
Do you have a second?
I had a great time.
We're not turning back.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
You're fun.
Are you planning on staying in Boston for a long time?
Draw a line from A to B.
She will be a beauty when she grows up.
I can't believe you lied to me.
That's good for a first try.
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
Put your mask on.
Please show me another camera.
He was crossing the street.
I understand your feelings.
I'm really fed up with this heat.
It's not a pyramid scheme.
We are having trouble with our new neighbor.
I convinced Tom to go to the party.
They don't work with us anymore.
I will always remember you.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
Where can I obtain a map of Europe?
Tom never talks about his family.
You have no evidence.
If that doesn't work, try something else.
Where do dreams come from?
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
My car is out of gas.
He touched me.
We didn't need to call the doctor.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
My father tried to teach us the value of work.
His book is very interesting.
Please turn on the television.
The fire was on the first floor.
How would you describe me?
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
"What would you like?" "I would like a dog."
They're having a break at the moment.
Is one thousand yen enough?
Here's looking at you, kid.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
Look out for pickpockets.
How many people are on board the ship?
He likes ham and eggs.
I must help you.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
Be nicer to your brother.
Today is Valentine's Day.
You've been warned.
I would like to insure this package.
I'm glad you decided to come.
Please knock before entering.
It snowed all day yesterday.
I love shopping in this mall.
I won't lose anything.
She's not here.
No one can do that.
He has come!
I want this one myself.
I thought you were against this proposal.
They all laughed at his error.
I live near here.
She is knitting a scarf.
Quit complaining.
Can we please turn this off?
You can't stay in here all day.
Don't you ever clean your room?
So what're you saying?
There was only a little milk left in the bottle.
My college has a dorm.
She didn't show up.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
He will leave Japan in April.
The fans sought to shake the actress's hand.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
You have to hold back.
It was working.
Tom is waiting at the airport.
I'm not an early riser.
I bought this racket two months ago.
How many more forks do you need?
If I were in your place, I would not do so.
You need to take a cold shower.
Did Tom tell you where to park?
Are you going to stop me?
The chances are that he is still in bed.
Tom will tell me everything eventually.
The storm prevented us from going out.
The door remained closed.
I don't think I can help you on Monday.
Sit wherever you like.
You'd probably really enjoy this book.
Turn to the left.
This report is very sloppily written.
I've never ridden a horse.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone can help me.
Can you determine what happened?
Have you ever kissed a boy?
That's all I was waiting for.
You have to do it again.
I'm busy all the time.
If possible, I'd like to know the name of the author.
She lay awake for hours thinking about him.
I have never been to Europe.
Do you want some coffee?
Did you enjoy yourself last evening?
It's important to read books.
That makes everything simpler.
I don't drink or smoke.
What else have you got going on?
You will obey us.
The Mayor addressed a large audience.
She kept me waiting for a long time.
Small family farms were disappearing.
Why don't we ask his advice?
You look familiar. Do I know you?
The plane landed without a problem.
Tom has been blind since birth.
She should have arrived home by now.
We'll be late for dinner.
All these books are mine.
My headache is finally gone.
Tom loved his family very much.
Did Tom look like he was happy?
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
I stayed there for three days.
We had a pleasant evening.
Think outside the box.
Do you feel any better?
I'd like to confirm the departure time.
The man looked at me.
A young girl was at the steering wheel.
Is it cloudy?
Do you enjoy studying?
I just wanted to thank everyone.
How's the weather?
I saw what you did.
Tom shot Mary.
These boxes are made of plastic.
How are we going to pay for that?
My feet are smaller than yours.
You're very funny.
Our train is late.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
I want to keep my kids safe.
Blue isn't my favorite color.
Tom's been going through a rough patch lately.
She lost her son in the war.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
I studied hard when I was in school.
I'm not used to this heat.
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
What happened to the others?
They were put in prison.
How could you not see this coming?
Those were the best years of my life.
I'm not who you think I am.
It's important that I be informed immediately.
You can't hurt my feelings.
Can you afford it?
I was detained.
The machine operates around the clock.
What are you doing today?
I really like you.
I have to dress up.
My brother gave me a cute doll.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
I've been busy.
I'm not going to do anything you don't want me to.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus.
That picture brought back a lot of memories.
Thank you for waiting.
The weather has improved.
Just ignore her.
That's what I'm asking you to do.
She's hot.
I'm not sure anymore.
He hit me twice.
I can't explain what happened.
She divided the cake into five pieces.
I waited until the last minute.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
I need to know.
Where were you last Monday?
I tried to call him up, but the line was busy.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
It's a weapon.
He kissed me on the forehead.
I have a Canadian neighbor.
Everyone knows me.
The salesgirl couldn't open the cash register.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
She tried to persuade him to attend the meeting.
Tom calls Mary every night.
They are disappointed in their son.
Tom knows he's not going to win.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
Let's all go.
She had never been so proud of herself.
You touched my heart.
She wants to attend the party.
You look fat.
I don't need your praise.
I'm not interested in that.
I like what I do.
Japan declared war on the United States in December, 1941.
Is his story true?
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
I come from a small town in Australia.
He has quite a few records.
Never hesitate to tell the truth.
Tom is in Boston now, isn't he?
Are you happy in your house?
She caught me by the arm.
I've finished.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Tom's house is on fire.
You're very talented.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
You don't need to wait.
I always feel hungry.
He started to learn Spanish from the radio.
Do you have the same thing in a different color?
You could've been hurt.
The jail is overcrowded.
We're winners.
My dog ate a paper towel. I wonder if he'll get sick.
I felt like an outcast among those people.
Half of the apples are rotten.
I never thought that about you.
Pets aren't allowed in the apartment building where I live.
We all have our secrets.
I work too much.
We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late.
I'll work.
He got the book for nothing.
I don't want to lose Mary.
It's not pertinent.
You're too naive.
Tom wanted Mary to have a good time.
Eat your peas.
It's not clear when he came here.
I assume you're angry.
I'm the one who asked for help.
I could find his address.
Tom said he found something strange.
I regret becoming a teacher.
You're wasting time.
I dream about Tom every night.
We have not been notified about their change of address.
The tree bent in the wind.
I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.
Prizes will be awarded at the end of the contest.
Did you steal that car?
We baked it together.
You can't be sure of that.
That building is the tallest in Japan.
Who was the girl you were talking to?
I have been to the barber's.
I really like seafood.
You must have seen them there.
We hope to see you again.
You're fortunate.
Without air we would die.
No one has ever seen God.
Who sent this to us?
He can swim on his back.
He went shopping.
Let me off at the train station, please.
I have no reason to lie to you.
A lot still remains to be done.
I spent the whole day reading that novel.
One minute has sixty seconds.
I didn't know they could do that.
Would you mind if I watched TV for a while?
You're courteous.
Be a good boy.
Whose bed is that?
My wife works in a nearby pub.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
You will never defeat me!
Tom promised to tell the truth.
We understand you perfectly.
Stop being a baby.
You should be proud of yourselves.
What do I have to do now that I'm registered?
I would like to be an English teacher.
That would be very funny.
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree.
He has greasy hair.
Tom quit school.
How many kids do you have?
Don't expose this chemical to direct sunlight.
Tom knew what Mary wanted to eat.
She's strong-willed.
I made friends with a student from abroad.
I folded all the towels.
She has not seen him for a long time.
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
They're traitors.
It's a piece of cake.
Please stop talking.
I had the strangest dream last night.
Give me a toothpick.
We'll be at home all day today.
Let's not forget the real reason we're here.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I have to go to Boston with Tom.
I think I can sing fairly well.
She advised him to go there alone.
I love winning.
I've never voted.
Watch your back.
I'd like to find out what this is.
That house needs repainting.
I think you did that intentionally.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
Tom's upstairs.
Please shut the door.
When I woke up today, I yawned, stretched, rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, and put on a pair of slippers.
I have finished.
I don't know how I know.
The door remained closed.
She dressed up for the party.
You don't have the nerve.
Tom is very busy with his work.
I hate the tie you're wearing.
Let me show you how we do that.
Can I count on you?
I've heard it all before.
The weather is very bad.
The air conditioner seems to be working now.
Do your best in everything.
The train came to a smooth stop.
He hung a picture on the wall.
She is a student.
You're wasting both of our time.
They seem surprised.
I'm looking for you.
It's very onerous.
Let me check your ticket.
Do you find the work too hard?
I let it fall.
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
They made the right choice.
We have all the evidence we need.
We're all retired.
Don't make me do this.
When did you notice that?
Tom will leave the company at the end of the year.
I ought to go there, but I won't.
The new Harry Potter movie is pretty lame.
Harvard is a good university.
How do you live like this?
I'm going to reconsider it.
I didn't expect that result.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
This stone weighs five tons.
It was like something out of a nightmare.
Did anybody eat with you?
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.
How do you pronounce your last name?
Tom can't win.
They're angry.
You did not answer my question.
I live with my family.
He is fresh from college.
I'm the one who's been lied to.
No one pays attention to Tom.
We all quit.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
I went to school.
I have an appointment I don't want to be late for.
I had too much to drink last night.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
Good luck.
Do you have a smaller size?
Do you mind if I help myself?
Why is it that you are always late?
It's shameful to treat a child so cruelly.
The weather was not only cold, but also wet.
Tom didn't feel tired.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
We're going to work tonight.
I don't belong.
I don't need a girlfriend.
I will have to study tomorrow.
Who is your teacher?
I didn't mean to pry.
He's cleaning out his closet.
He died recently.
Our yacht club has ten members.
Be polite to everyone.
I just wrote a book.
Tom is daydreaming.
The problem was I couldn't speak French.
This really is great weather.
How could you say that?
By postponing what you have to do, you run the risk of never being able to do it.
His pictures are very famous.
Where is the book?
Why would I know that?
Tom doesn't even have a pencil.
We admired the beauty of the scenery.
You can't just go.
Are you here on holiday?
I've got to do this right now.
I don't get the connection.
Would you like to eat something?
I want a piece of chocolate cake.
There's a big hole.
It's time-consuming.
We have no need for assistance.
I swear it's the last time.
I don't have any friends to talk to.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Who is your favorite player?
Tom has a lot of problems.
Generally speaking, the climate of Japan is mild.
If only I could sing well.
Mary cut herself while she was chopping up onions.
It's a great way to make friends.
I've heard you've been sick.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
We were just playing.
I'm astonished.
What did you think I was going to do?
You are a mean person.
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
I like to be prepared.
Actually, that's what I thought.
Our supplies are running out.
I know you're not going to come to my party, but I wish you were.
You've suffered enough.
Tom will be here by evening.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
They seem happy.
Let me write it down so I don't forget.
It's not necessary.
She advised him to read more books.
I hate to see you so miserable.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Who is your favorite player?
I will go when they come back here.
Hey, where are you?
You're a terrible person.
I think we could help each other.
The last part of the trip was across the desert.
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon.
This is an important event.
Tom handed an envelope to Mary.
I did not understand him at all.
My best friend is in Rome now.
Try some.
You should act more calmly.
I know her address.
You're not sleeping enough.
You'll get there in time, as long as you don't miss the train.
We're looking for a volunteer.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
Tell me how you solved the problem.
I told him to work hard or he would fail.
Can you speak another language?
The fire that broke out last night was judged to be caused by arson.
The troops were annihilated.
I was a teacher.
I see you've made a friend.
Ten minutes after they had passed Nara, the car ran out of gas.
I wonder what Tom thinks.
I'm trying to think of some ideas for this article I'm writing.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
Don't watch too much TV.
Is there anything to eat?
I don't think I can keep that promise.
I think we should call Tom.
Anywhere with a bed will do.
That guy is off his rocker!
May I visit you tomorrow?
I'm a little scared.
Last year, there was a bad harvest.
It was a stupid idea.
There was a striking resemblance between them.
Married people are happier than unmarried people.
I will be sixteen in May.
When do you want to start?
I run a small business.
What're we looking for?
Did you have a good time yesterday?
My girlfriend was crying.
I'm content with my current position.
I have an early memory of my grandmother darning socks.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
Tom has been behaving oddly.
When can you start?
We're trapped.
I'll take a look at it.
Tom helped Mary carry her suitcases.
You may come if you like.
I don't know who won.
I have enough money to buy it.
Tom is not my son.
She lost her money, her family and her friends.
It looks like a UFO.
I'm not disagreeing.
They want to know what your plan is.
I play the trumpet.
Where was I?
Can't you ride a bicycle?
I am a housewife.
They can't do that.
Come on, admit it.
Tom is three years older than you.
I already said that.
Don't hesitate to take the opportunity to propose to her.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
Is it a direct flight?
I just want you to listen to me.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
You have only to watch what I do.
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight.
That's OK.
They sank ten enemy ships.
I don't know what fear is.
That's lame.
You're not my type.
I thought you would understand.
I wish I had a reason not to go.
I made rice.
We haven't come to a decision yet.
Did you catch what he said?
It's obvious.
I like to be thorough.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
Just relax.
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
They've written a bill for health care.
I hate it when you do that.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
I know you're not lying.
Don't worry. We'll get the money.
It is time to stop watching television.
They incited him to commit the crime.
You're very brave.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
Why do you keep giving him money?
How did it get here?
I felt excited.
He shut the door.
I fear that I might not be able to help you.
Tom couldn't do even one push-up when he started training.
I want a match. Do you have one?
You might not find it.
Don't even get me started.
She fell in love with him.
How would you like your eggs?
We can work on it.
Tom described the problem in detail.
This house has a solid foundation.
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
He regrets what he did.
They're leaving.
I decided to stay one more day.
I didn't look at Tom.
Children threw stones at him.
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
The problem is that our car will not be available on that day.
Ignore Tom.
He did not intend to hurt your feelings.
It rained heavily all day long.
Writing love letters isn't easy for me.
I sleep on my side.
We went on talking about the matter.
Three more passengers got on the bus.
Your behavior was inexcusable.
Are you still scared?
Why are all these people here?
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
Tom is your friend.
This dress would look good on you.
I disposed of my old coat.
Are you scared of me?
Are you sure about this?
Bears like to scratch their back on tree bark.
I returned to Japan.
Everybody loves her.
Sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.
Who's working tonight?
I don't know what to call you.
I bought a shirt yesterday.
It's all a big misunderstanding.
She made the same mistake as before.
Would you please take my picture?
Are you going or not?
No one was in the park.
Don't ever do that again.
I don't feel like studying English today.
I can't believe you fell for that.
This was my idea.
I have no homework today.
Your T-shirt's on backwards.
Don't open the door for anyone.
You haven't seen Tom this morning, have you?
The equations are very complicated.
She patiently waited for him.
He greeted the lady.
Do you know French?
You're very timid.
I am yours and you are mine.
Someday, we'll know.
Fill the bucket with water.
She is progressing in Chinese.
Your name is Tom, right?
You have problems.
Our school burned down.
I'm in love with you.
Does this actually make you happy?
It's kind of boring.
Let's hope for good results.
No one flinched.
You're very sophisticated.
Let me treat you next time, then.
How about running?
I have to go home.
I gave you what you asked for.
I'd like to think about it a little bit longer.
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
Shut up and let me think.
He's away on business.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
I don't know if I should stay or run.
What's the oldest thing you own?
That's unimportant.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
He is one of the American presidential candidates.
He was involved in the trouble.
Over 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles bombard the earth every day from space, most of which goes unnoticed.
Do you know this song?
Tom doesn't really want me to help him.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
No one disagreed.
As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away.
I couldn't believe my ears.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
That's my dog.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
Are you happy?
I have to buy a new scanner.
I have a problem.
It is none the less true.
I missed the two o'clock plane.
I told Tom that Mary was telling the truth.
May I take a rest?
Do you really mean it?
What happened was horrible.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
How much is the rent per month?
It's important to know one's limits.
He is good at playing tennis.
Tom loves sports events.
They had trouble finding the place.
I drink tea without sugar.
I don't want to offend you.
I hate dancing.
You guys are no fun.
Is this going to work?
Medication and alcohol often don't mix.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
Are we broke?
French developed from Latin.
I can't believe you just said that.
You don't smoke, do you?
You are to do as I tell you.
I asked him to lend me some money.
Why have you been avoiding me?
She's a looker.
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
It'll help you save energy.
Do a lot of people live in your town?
Are you certain?
Stir the soup.
I don't have anything to complain about.
We're getting married.
He gave me a ride home.
I've brought you a little something.
I'm going to mop this up.
What time did your friend go home?
I'd rather not comment on that.
Democracy is the dictatorship of the majority.
I'm too busy.
Tom wants you to do him a favor.
Don't you all agree?
She is frightened of thunder.
One of my friends knows you.
Forgive me, I'm a bit nervous.
I work alone.
What is the cat up to?
What's Tom going to do next summer?
He appeared thinner every day.
There must be something in there.
A man is picking out a tune on the guitar.
I will bring it right away.
Am I under suspicion?
These are not words.
Tom is sadly mistaken.
How many do you need?
Get out of here immediately!
Tom hid it behind the door.
Do you think it's possible?
Are you up to the task?
You may go there.
I have no books to read.
The result remains to be seen.
I don't know what to think.
You understand this, don't you?
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
I take it for granted that you will join.
I was afraid he might die.
Tom is growing up.
I don't feel any pain.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
She forgot to write him.
Have you made any friends yet?
It's a classic.
I am not rich, nor do I wish to be.
We found that everyone was asleep.
It was beginner's luck.
I didn't see much.
Stupid question, stupid answer.
Are there survivors?
She is not to blame.
Why don't you give us a moment to talk?
Don't let that dog come near me!
You said you had a theory.
Let bygones be bygones.
My bag is empty.
Tom sensed Mary's disappointment.
Why are we doing all this?
I suppose anything's possible.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
There is a long wait between trains.
Tom didn't say anything at all.
I'm not married anymore.
Tom didn't calm down until much later.
Watch out for thieves around here.
She was indignant when I said she was lying.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I have to admit I'm curious.
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
These are our children.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
I figure that she will succeed in her business.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Do you know where they are?
What kind of meal did you eat?
You're off the hook.
Let's go get snockered like we did last weekend.
What kind of shampoo do you use?
These shoes are hers.
How's that again?
Don't they drive you mad?
I am sorry that my friend is not here.
I don't know how to address you.
It was a team effort.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
He hit on a splendid idea.
I have not heard from him for a long time.
Life can be hard.
I hate my mother-in-law.
I had a job when I was your age.
Her car broke down on the way.
Finding his office was easy.
Take as many as you want.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
This is our house.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I'll go next month.
Easy come, easy go.
You're so beautiful in that dress.
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?
You can't have both.
I'm loaded.
What time is your plane landing?
Get out of this car.
I built this for you.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
Shoes are sold in pairs.
Where is the station?
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
I've got things under control now.
I'm very interested in social studies.
We'll explain.
Tom isn't bothering me.
He excelled in music even as a child.
What are your measurements?
That isn't to my liking.
I think you look hot.
I have work to do, so go away and leave me alone.
Who forced you to do that?
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
I'm astonished by her cleverness.
No one will miss me.
Let me do the talking.
Please follow me.
This isn't funny.
Nuclear power is used to generate electricity.
That belongs to us.
I love to cook.
I wonder why birds migrate.
Lemons are sour.
You've been very kind to me.
I really don't want to go back to jail.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
They found each other.
We met today.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
You nearly broke my jaw.
Do you know his brother?
I'll kill the both of you.
I'll lend it to you.
The towel was quite useless.
I think we're going to have a very strong team.
I figured I had enough money.
People like him because he is kind.
He's English, but lives in India.
Where did you find this evidence?
I think it's a good idea.
Let's make it three o'clock.
How would you describe me?
I meet him at the club.
We can't afford that.
I want to know how you know that.
If you want me to kiss you, all you have to do is ask.
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
Stop screaming like a girl.
I think Tom is going to be OK.
Tom decided to give up.
He bought a hat.
Be careful about what you eat.
If that were true, what would you do?
I don't want your gold.
Tom didn't want to let Mary into his house.
Let's handle this one problem at a time.
I hate jealous women.
I'm glad you're my friend.
I will give you what little money I have.
The planes flew over the village.
I know you haven't done it yet.
He was given the sack.
It's like being in a candy shop.
Tom overstepped his authority.
The doctor advised that she take a holiday.
I saw a bum at the train station.
That's something we'll improve on.
I no longer have any reason to do this.
Never ask a question if you aren't prepared to hear the answer.
The traffic crept along at a snail's pace.
He and I are cousins.
The old man stopped suddenly and looked back.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel a lot better.
Don't come to me now with that. You should have said something when it originally happened.
I have all these apples to carry, not to mention this bag of potatoes.
It was really overpriced.
I've seen my dog sneeze but never my cat.
We're not trying to make amends.
Am I wrong?
My dream came true.
Let's try this.
Was anyone else injured?
The sky was dark.
I had never seen my father cry before that time.
He got out from under the car.
I don't know any more than you do.
I think it's time to go home.
There is no reason for this fear.
I've been learning how to write kanji with a brush.
Tom tripped over something.
Did you paint this?
How very curious!
I had no idea Tom would do that.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
You're very generous.
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
I am all ears.
He looked unfriendly at first.
Sumo wrestling is a traditional Japanese sport.
I've never seen such a beautiful flower.
I figured you'd enjoy this movie.
Could you spare me a few minutes?
Tom is a decent sort of guy.
Take off your hat when you enter a classroom.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
This tea is very hot.
The house was in flames.
I met him on the previous day.
I do not love him any longer.
Which concert did you choose to attend?
Are you still upset about what happened?
Tom said that he didn't know you.
She slapped his face.
I need to go milk the cows.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
I wish you could be a little quieter.
There're no lights.
Could I see you tonight?
I'm not very good at swimming.
Her sewing basket, dresser drawers and pantry shelves are all systematically arranged in apple-pie order.
Please come this way.
Please stop talking. I need to concentrate on my game.
She is almost as tall as you are.
Apparently, we have to do that today.
You're a liar.
They lost.
She demanded to see the manager.
I don't want to go with you.
I like figuring things out.
Fill in this application form and send it at once.
He is capable of doing such a thing.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
Tom wasn't home, but Mary was.
We've run out of beer.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
Hand me the hammer, will you?
His house was small and old.
I left part of the meal uneaten.
I'm using that cup.
That's why I'm late.
I like sleeping.
Why don't we go and see a movie?
The game starts at two tomorrow afternoon.
Show me the photos, please.
You can go to the station by bus.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
Did I startle you?
I don't want you to go back.
Are you telling us the truth?
He felt very lonely.
I thought you trusted me.
My friend Tom has twice as many stamps as I do.
I have a dictionary.
I know how this looks to you.
Christians view human nature as inherently sinful.
Where did you go?
You can do whatever you want now.
I look after my grandfather.
I go to school because I want to learn.
She sometimes gets depressed.
Don't phone her now.
Why are dogs easier to train than cats?
You were terrified, weren't you?
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
It hurts.
Tom must've taken the wrong train.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
I caused an accident.
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
Tom is a good cook.
It was very cold.
Tom was like a brother to me.
Death is similar to sleep.
I didn't hear you come in.
I don't know this game.
He has two cars.
I think we should talk.
I have to go. It's getting late.
I don't think you understand.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
The door opened and a man came out.
They found out.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
I'll try it.
He handed in his paper.
Her only pleasure is listening to music.
I don't want to eat with Tom.
He took charge of the family business after his father died.
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
There are few legal constraints on the sale of firearms in the U.S.
His book inspired me.
Tom knows Mary is wrong.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Was there anything else you wanted me to do?
You should have a doctor examine your condition.
Thanks a lot.
This room is too big.
My grandfather gave me a birthday present.
Don't despise a man because he is poor.
She promised to meet him last night, but she never showed up.
We're not all teachers.
Something is wrong.
I just can't remember.
That's simply wrong.
I didn't expect to find you here.
Will you please show me the way?
That was Tom's cousin.
I never murdered anybody.
What a relief!
I would never hurt a child.
I will make her happy.
I lived in a small town.
Every time I read the Bible, I am deeply moved.
Mary is the youngest of the three sisters.
I agree to this plan.
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
Don't be so dramatic.
Leave your desk as it is.
He has twice as many books as I do.
I love you like a son.
I strongly advise you to take this medicine right away.
I never for a moment imagined we wouldn't get home before the storm hit.
I really can't be late.
Be friendly.
You know it doesn't matter.
My brother has died.
What you are saying does not make sense.
I ran as fast as I could.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
What time did you close the store last night?
It didn't end well.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
Forget it!
Were you obedient?
Let's go for a ride in my car.
I wanted to impress you.
I'll tell you what the problem is.
I'm not really that thirsty.
The trip will take at least a week.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
I don't recognize over half of these names.
I want to drink a cold beer.
Give it up.
Did he go there?
Don't you feel stupid now?
I discovered too late that I left out the most important part of my speech.
What year were you born?
This meat is chicken.
I must go to work.
I don't deserve it.
Something bit me.
Hurry up, girls.
I have finished.
Where is everybody?
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
This history book is written for high school students.
We're all witnesses.
I want to join your group.
His behavior is very odd today.
She's been poisoned.
We went to the park to take pictures.
I can't help you now.
You just screwed up.
Have you ever given money to a beggar?
He turned his back on the old tradition.
When did the robbery take place?
Let's keep each other company for a while.
Who forced you to do that?
I think you'll have very little difficulty in getting a driver's license.
He was drunk and angry.
I can't figure out how to post a comment to this blog.
I'm about to go out.
I know you're not coming to my party, but I wish you were.
Do you plan to buy that car?
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I cooked the pasta too long.
Is there anybody left?
He's looking good.
She's heating the water.
I got really mad.
I'm surprised to see you.
You're sneaky.
Do not be shy. Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
This book is better than that one.
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe.
I'll do no such thing.
I think you are mistaken.
You know very well how it happened.
I was very flattered.
Traveling abroad is very interesting.
You really are good.
I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be.
He is very talented.
Are you afraid of it?
I'll hang onto it for now.
Tom is the most influential man in Boston.
I owe what I am today to my parents.
That worked.
Show me the way, please.
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
This is beautiful.
I need a few more days.
Don't fret.
That's what you think.
This is taking forever.
It seems that he believes what he said is right.
She was blackmailed by him.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
Do you have to work tonight?
I think we should look into it.
Don't make stupid jokes.
He takes everything lightly.
I really don't want to sit in that room.
It was clear that she was not concerned with the matter.
My wife is hiding something from me.
I play tennis every day.
The forest is teeming with monkeys.
A square has four sides.
They are both working at the pet store.
I've got plenty of friends.
You can't hurt me any more than you already have.
They made me wait for a long time.
It used to be nearly impossible.
Are you nervous?
He was worn out when he got home.
I think that might be a good idea.
I'm glad to be here.
I heard a woman scream.
That was years ago.
That's my dictionary.
This gift is for you.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
He is always generous to poor people.
I just want to be loved.
They spoke briefly.
I feel faint.
I wish I could figure out how to get more people to visit my website.
His company didn't survive the crisis.
What she said wasn't true.
We already have three events booked for next week.
Tom's job was outsourced to China.
I don't think it's true.
Can I take a picture here?
This is what is called a 'present' in some countries and 'bribery' in others.
I got a temporary job at the firm.
He let the dog loose in the yard.
She has plenty of work to do.
I have nothing particular to say now.
I have already finished the job.
Tom saw something.
We should sometimes pause to think.
Can you shut the door on your way out?
You're doing it right.
It is impossible for a growing child to keep still for an hour.
I know her very well.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
What month is this?
Why did Tom leave so suddenly?
By the time she gets there, it will be nearly dark.
May I ask you a favor?
I was a little put out by this.
Are both of you still single?
It does seem like an excellent plan.
He is tall and lean.
She writes to her son every now and then.
I think you ought to listen.
She repulses him.
I don't have a snowmobile.
Just ignore it.
I need it yesterday.
Everything's very cheap.
Does someone here speak Japanese?
We partied all night long.
Could we have a table near the window?
He doesn't have any friends.
Please don't forget to shut the door.
It's about time you got a haircut.
Tom says a lot of things.
I have known her since she was a child.
Your French is excellent.
Do you like English?
You're crafty.
I'm rich.
No one knows his real name.
All I want to do is finish what I started.
The hypnotist was able to put his subject into a trance.
Don't waste your breath.
The backdoor was broken.
I rewrote my report.
Her ability to write with her foot is amazing.
You take me for a sucker, don't you?
Is that warranted?
Do you take work home with you?
I shouldn't have done that without your permission.
What did they hit you with?
The world is changing.
This stuff is amazing.
He was my best friend.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him.
It was very cold last night, so we didn't go outside, but stayed indoors.
He owes his success to good luck.
I like dogs, but my sister likes cats.
Get out.
I'm good at cooking.
You've got to take care of yourself.
We were all drenched with perspiration.
Don't drink that.
Somebody has left his hat.
Did you meet someone else?
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Do you have them?
That song reminds me of a certain girl.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
That's right.
Have you ever climbed Mt. Fuji?
Women don't drive as well as men.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Do you remember?
Tom was right after all.
Don't act like that.
A bad smell permeated the room.
Beat it, kids!
Why didn't you come to the party?
Could I have a screwdriver?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
Would that make you happy?
They are Russian.
You startled me!
All of a sudden, the lights went on.
Are you enjoying the play?
The country's economy depends on agriculture.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.
I like my life.
We need not have hurried.
We're going north.
Tom asked me who that man was.
He was stunned.
Can I talk to you a sec?
I hope it does not rain tomorrow.
I want answers to my questions.
Make your move.
You gotta get more organized.
He quickly runs out of breath.
Do you deny it?
We're smashed.
You're adorable.
I lost everything I had.
Tom showed Mary several pictures of his house.
You must study your whole life.
Which one should I use?
You are a beautiful butterfly.
I was quite nervous.
All things considered, my father's life was a happy one.
I want you to kiss me.
Mary has stopped smoking.
I feel a lot safer now.
He went away without saying a word.
They agreed to start early.
Do you see anything?
You are a good person.
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
Thanks for joining us.
I have lots of ideas.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow?
He is twelve years old. He is tall for his age.
I really love my job.
He's too old for you.
Kindly refrain from smoking.
Let's do it again.
I know this is difficult for you.
He used a lot of honey.
I can't talk to Tom.
For someone who's supposed to be an expert, you don't seem to know much.
Where did you hear that story?
She was as thin as a rail.
Does he live here?
I used to listen to English programs.
We don't lock our doors.
Are you excited?
I guess that's OK.
The attempt ended in failure.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
I know Tom is groggy.
I don't know anymore.
This train runs between Tokyo and Osaka.
Tom has been blind since birth.
They made the goal.
This job shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
Didn't you know that oil floats on water?
That should be possible.
I want to do well.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
I had enough sense to get out of there.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
I don't want to offend you.
I didn't break it.
We can't satisfy everyone.
I am married and I have two sons.
Are any seats still available?
We have no means of transportation.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
Everybody needs food, don't they?
This diamond is fake.
It's your bedtime.
Nature plays an important role in our life.
Please bring me a cup of tea.
I think you must be getting tired.
How long were you gone?
I am hers and she is mine.
I'm available now.
I thought you were serious.
My father isn't at home.
This task took three hours.
I'll take care of the bill.
They're too fat.
Give me a reason to stay.
Tom kissed Mary.
"May I call you tonight?" "Sure."
What're you all dressed up for?
She grabbed him by the hand.
I'm not paid to do that.
What on earth are you talking about?
That was a big surprise.
I fixed it.
He closely resembles his father.
Mary invested in the stock because the financial advisor fooled her.
I seldom do that alone.
Tom is proud of you.
I don't want to offend you.
It's not my concern.
I want all my children to go to college.
I shouldn't have told Tom.
Have you asked if they want one?
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
Please breathe through your nose.
Show me your passport, please.
It's difficult being rich.
There's a lot of danger during a big storm.
Time has come to get serious.
Caesar leaves Gaul, crosses the Rubicon, and enters Italy.
I just don't want you to get upset.
He affirmed that he saw the crash.
Tom is helpful.
You have beautiful hair.
Tom waited for Mary to answer.
Tom spoke louder than usual.
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.
I'm not very patient.
I am tired of reading.
I don't know when he'll come back.
You should know better.
You're such a flirt.
Don't hurt anybody else.
He's good.
Nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day.
I wouldn't do that for all the money in the world.
I do love you.
Grab my hand.
I didn't even notice you.
I remember giving him the key.
You may disagree with me.
Hello everyone!
You don't have to apologize.
I'm out of practice.
Please be careful.
Do you sometimes give your sister money?
They fought until the end.
Don't ever lie to me again.
You don't have to make a different dish for every person.
I feel betrayed.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
They lied.
Why were you there?
How many people were there?
We saw it on the news.
You broke the rule.
Not even one taxi stopped.
I can't take it anymore.
She is interested in learning new ideas.
English is useful in diplomacy and tourism.
Tom is in need of a vacation.
Will you help me look for my purse?
You can't help them.
He speaks Japanese as if he were Japanese.
I live near the sea so I often get to go to the beach.
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
Did you get her letter?
I forgot my key.
One of my favorite authors is Herman Melville.
I don't hate you.
He has no friends to talk with.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
What do you want it for?
Where ever did you buy it?
Can you see anything over there?
She has two daughters.
You're not upset, are you?
Open the windows.
I am not ready yet.
Don't take it personally.
I don't think I can do it.
Which color do you like more, blue or red?
Could you turn down the music, please?
Do you think it's just a coincidence?
Tom is perfect for you.
Be friendly.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
The government was obliged to make changes in its foreign policy.
You gotta get more organized.
Only adults may watch that film.
What is old age? First you forget names, then you forget faces, then you forget to pull your zipper up, then you forget to pull it down.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
Say the alphabet backwards.
I can't blame you. It was my fault.
May I put it down here?
Tom was the only one who laughed.
I remember meeting you before.
He invested his money in stocks.
I don't feel so good.
You didn't expect to find me here, did you?
I feel very lonely these days.
The native people were forced off their land.
Can I extend my stay?
Does Tom want to watch the movie with us?
I'd like to get together with you tonight.
I agree with you.
The transition won't be easy.
Is your watch correct?
Here I am again.
We lost sight of each other.
I sincerely hope things improve for you.
The moment she was alone, she opened the letter.
I write in my diary every day.
It rained yesterday, but it cleared up this morning.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
I want to discuss this with your manager.
I've started bleeding.
Every spring the river floods here.
Do you want the long version or the short version?
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Lock your doors.
No proof was ever found.
She felt something between love and hatred.
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live.
That's your half.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
They relaxed around the campfire.
We must observe the rules.
Please write to me once in a while.
I guess I've been too busy.
You should get your hair cut.
That's very kind of you.
Don't you tell me my job.
Tom won the contest.
He was ready to face his fate.
You blew it, Tom.
I received my birthday present.
I think it's time for me to apologize to her.
I'll take two or three days off.
I used to do that as a kid.
However hard you try, you can't finish it in a day.
I'm happy that it's over.
Zoos are like prisons for animals.
You need to be more careful from now on.
She came to see me the other day.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
He described the incident in detail.
It's his first day at school.
Where do I turn?
The Japan Sea separates Japan from the Asian Continent.
I suppose you are right.
You are hopeless.
Who's the next person on your list?
This isn't supposed to be happening.
Handling dynamite can be dangerous.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
Are you up for it?
One hour of sleep before midnight is worth two hours after.
She has a lot of friends here.
It looks like the dog wants something to eat.
He died yesterday.
I can speak a little English.
How old is that painting?
That's almost impossible to believe.
You won't be harmed.
Leave that job to the experts!
You'll have a hard time.
I haven't seen you for a long time. Come and see me once in a while.
Are you deaf?
What was the cause of the accident?
Why did you back away?
You should dump Tom.
Tom made a lot of spelling mistakes.
I know that you're a teacher.
We should proceed with great caution.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
I want to thank you for all you've done.
I don't know how to make you happy.
It's not personal.
The boy next door fell head first from a tree.
What is the emergency?
What else would you advise?
I'm impatient.
Don't touch the computer.
Don't talk about it in his presence.
I wish he would write more often.
There's nobody on this ship except us.
It rained for hours and hours.
I can come if you want.
I want to believe that everything's all right.
She looks familiar.
I made them myself.
According to the papers, the man has finally confessed.
This job doesn't pay.
Tom won't play tennis today.
Did you really think it would be different this time?
I can't believe you're giving up.
This is the important part.
Do you have your keys?
You need to reboot your computer.
I'll look after that child.
Over three thousand people attended the concert.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
How many kids do you have?
I would've waited.
That's not what he said.
This table is taken.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
Tom tried to save Mary.
She helped him tie his tie.
I don't have a fever.
He wanted to test his limits.
I held up my end of the deal.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
I should've paid a little more attention.
After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years.
She lived with him all her life.
Republicans were defeated in many states.
Tom is likely to be enjoying that.
Could somebody get me a spoon?
I hope Tom and Mary are at school.
What happened to your car?
I don't think that'll happen again.
That's all for now, folks.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
He is very slow at making friends with anybody.
I did that because I was ordered to.
He asked me if I knew her telephone number.
I am not good at mathematics.
This is the best party I've been to all year.
He is on the radio.
He keeps on asking me for money.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
Do you trust anyone?
She always buys expensive clothes.
I lost my temper.
Tom won't visit Boston.
Don't even talk to me.
My cat loves shrimp.
I think you're just wasting your time.
Can you open the window?
I don't like Tom very much, to be honest.
Are you through with the newspaper?
Who are we working for?
Did she show you the picture?
Come to my room between three and four.
Nice to meet you.
Does this bus go to the beach?
Take a few days off.
What woke you up?
I like coffee hot.
Snow covered the bus.
I could walk.
The more guests there are, the more difficult it is to keep a surprise party secret.
I told Tom that I was tired.
I use it every day.
I don't need you to take care of me.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else to read it.
We can't lose sight of that.
My greatest ambition is to be an opera singer.
Someone broke the window.
You must never lose your temper.
Who designed the White House?
My mother is preparing supper.
I know it's a lot of money.
I'm at your service.
I think that I came too early.
That's logical.
Please fix it.
Tom isn't good at cooking.
Have you ever been lonely?
You're not trying to trick me, are you?
We have not heard from him since last year.
The hungry cat kept meowing outside the window.
I don't really care what you think.
Where's the beach?
They forced her to confess.
This is the final straw.
I've been worried all along.
I don't know who you are anymore.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
You may not like it.
There are more girls than boys in this school.
One of you is lying.
Put the pliers in the tool box.
This coffee shop is cozy.
They want you to resign.
Tom tried to drink his problems away.
The boy denied having stolen the bicycle.
When will you leave?
Have you decided?
Tom bolted the door.
It's completely normal.
I don't know Tom's girlfriend.
Her novel was translated into Japanese.
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
She carried that table by herself.
Do you recognize anyone?
If he sends me any letters, I just tear them up and throw them away.
I know more about you than you realize.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
If you get bit by a rabid dog, you'll need a tetanus shot.
He lives alone.
Tom must've heard us enter.
How can you be so sure?
Laughter is infectious.
What do you think happens then?
Please correct my bill.
You need to leave here at once.
What time do you close?
The pain has mostly gone away.
Who notified you?
Three years have passed since then.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker and I don't really think I need to.
I think you did very well.
I reconsidered your proposal.
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
My cousin isn't the kind of person who'd ever break a promise.
She likes tennis as well as basketball.
The nurse checked Tom's pulse.
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep.
Was the movie interesting?
They're dying.
I really thought I could do it.
They used truth serum.
Are you ready for the trip?
I'm just following orders.
It was one of the worst experiences of my life.
I can't feel anything.
Neither of us could've done that alone.
You do seem a little on edge.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't know Mary.
I need to know who I have to give this to.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
How far away do you think that ship is?
Can you hear us?
I want a hot shower before I go back to work.
You don't have to stay to the end.
Tom promised me that tonight he'd sing that new song he wrote.
I've got to take my library books back before January 25th.
What time are you coming back?
When did she leave the classroom?
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
I telephoned to make sure that he was coming.
My father is in the garden.
He did not want her to leave.
Did you enjoy going to exhibits in Romania?
The movie received mixed reviews.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
This is getting difficult.
Go home now.
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
I have to help my mother.
I like trains better than buses.
I opened the box. It was empty.
It is very small.
They should go, regardless of whether they're men or women.
The jury found the man guilty of murder.
You're on the path of success.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
She gave in to the temptation.
Make sure the door is locked.
They don't help.
We have a reservation.
One more person will be joining us later.
Please choose wisely.
You're very busy.
I should've studied more.
The recent shortage of coffee has given rise to a lot of problems.
That hat looks good on you.
Has he given up cigarettes?
You're very understanding.
Someone has stolen all my money.
I don't know what's happening.
I'm glad we didn't do that.
Did I show you this?
I'll do it with you.
You're crafty.
She is coming home at the end of this month.
Where is the cat?
She's too loud.
It was a very long meeting.
I'm sure you have other skills.
Not everyone needs a college degree.
You get used to it.
Is it good news?
I always do the same thing.
We had no customers, so we shut the shop early.
People used to write books using typewriters.
This is totally worthless.
Tom rarely leaves the house on Monday.
It's nice of you to give me a lift.
I like to talk about the good old days.
He turned the corner.
Which sports do you like?
Make up your own mind.
I really ought to go.
The dog was covered in mud from head to foot.
Let's find out where Tom went.
That looks good on you.
You're careful.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
Stop acting like a child.
Far from being pleased, my father is very angry.
It's not a big deal.
Tom lives in the worst part of town.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
It's an abuse of power.
I didn't touch anything.
They won't have arrived yet.
I don't feel like joking.
We need to get going.
It's midnight.
She liked tennis and became a tennis coach.
I'm tired of eating at the school cafeteria.
His explanation doesn't make sense at all.
Can the rumor be true?
I fell in love with you.
I will go if you go.
Some animals eat their young.
I'm not a great photographer.
Of course you can stay.
We're going to discuss the problem tomorrow.
How do you define success?
You should practice playing the violin every day.
Two years went by before I could find a good job.
I'm being sensible.
I accept your apology.
I love this time of year.
I think that Tom will be OK.
Are you ready?
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
I don't mind if I get wet.
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
It's my fault, not yours.
Try it again.
He put his hands in his pockets.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
You can do it any way you like.
Autumn came and the leaves started to fall.
Baseball is my favorite sport.
I thought you were older than me.
I'll just go.
When was Tom fired?
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
Tom is going to be very pleased.
You can't tell anyone about this.
Shall I draw a map for you?
You don't have to come.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
You may kiss me if you like.
How's that again?
I'm unlikely to do that again.
I don't think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong.
I've missed another chance.
You need to stop.
Tom found his new job interesting.
I hate to see you so miserable.
Are you sure you don't need my help?
He let me go.
Don't make it worse.
Tom is older than me.
I suggest you cooperate.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
Why are you alone?
I don't have the number.
I just feel so helpless.
I'm going over to my sister's.
That's true.
Is that ring made of real gold?
She begged him to send her home.
I just couldn't resist doing that.
They are pilots.
Tell Tom.
You must not stay in bed.
I think you're drinking out of my glass.
Tom didn't last long.
The factory produces ammunition.
Right now I can't think of anything else.
He says what he thinks regardless of other people's feelings.
I'm dreading the exam.
That's no good.
She talked him into accepting the bribe.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary told him she was leaving him.
Tom dove into the swimming pool.
Everybody jumped.
I have seen it a lot.
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a joke.
She beat him to death.
My watch is ten minutes slow.
I'll pay for it.
I can't reach the ceiling.
We're not watching.
I didn't say you were crazy.
That's what Tom would do.
Have you decided?
This does not apply to students.
I felt strong.
I have nothing to do with that crime.
Tom broke my heart.
Stay home until six.
She is almost as tall as you.
Tom doesn't like to talk about his past.
I lost my favorite pen.
When did you see her dancing with him?
I think it's true.
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
He went by bicycle.
I left my card at home.
Maybe it's true.
The waiters bumped into each other.
I bid against him.
I don't want to hear your excuses.
I was bored with his old jokes.
What's his most recent novel?
Do you want to know why Tom left?
The answer's no.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
I also use this study for receiving guests.
I am a gentleman's daughter.
Don't go out after dark.
Nobody knows what it is that has been bothering him so much.
She had no sooner seen me than she ran away.
I haven't had a vacation in years.
Where were they going?
She is always buying expensive clothes.
It's a fad.
Tom asked Mary to watch the children.
Why would anyone do that?
Please tell me what that is.
Luckily nobody got killed.
What I want isn't tea, but coffee.
Don't leave them alone.
You're new here, aren't you?
I'd rather not answer that question.
The evening meal is served between 9 and 12.
I'd like something to eat.
How much do you remember?
Would you like to go to fishing with me this weekend?
Why does Tom always look so tired?
The government is not doing its best to solve the housing problem.
Being very tired, I went to bed early.
Tom did his best to avoid making eye contact with Mary.
When will she return home?
Lots of people in Japan are indifferent to politics.
Stop filming.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
I want to go with you tonight.
Do you have a cellphone?
He chose a good wife.
She still hated him, even after he died.
I want to rent a car.
I think you've got what I need.
Don't try to do too much.
Tom writes to me at least once a week.
So what were we talking about?
Are you all right now?
Do you drink alcohol?
I always keep my word.
Please say the alphabet in reverse.
Have you measured it?
They supported his right to speak freely.
Let's be honest. That joke was about me.
You have to keep fit.
She opened the letter quickly.
They had to read the book many times.
That will put you in danger.
Did your uncle let you drive his car?
You're starting to scare me.
I am ready to go with you.
Please explain it.
Who did you come with?
This is going too far.
How do you deal with it?
It's the fastest train in the world.
I hope the economy picks up soon.
It sickens me.
I'm right, aren't I?
He crossed the Pacific Ocean in thirty days.
I've made this mistake before.
Baby ducks are cute.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
He drives a hard bargain.
Don't make me answer that question.
Give me something to drink.
I never went back.
Leave the book where it is.
I don't understand English.
I'll allow this.
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.
I checked my bags.
She thought she could get him to like her.
Did you see anyone?
I'm sorry, I don't have change.
Study harder from now on.
I appreciate your work.
Tom promised that he wouldn't do that.
Are they all the same?
You should ask a physician for his advice before taking this medicine.
It is almost ten o'clock.
Will you drive me home?
You should go on a diet.
What would you like to do while you're here?
Give Tom a second chance.
I used to work in an electronics store.
What do you feel most proud of?
What does Tom need?
Answer the question.
Quit acting like a child.
I didn't say it happened here.
Every word is significant.
No passengers were injured.
Take a little nap on the couch.
He acts like he knows everything.
All of us, except him, went.
They knocked on the door and said they had come to arrest him.
I only have a few books.
I want to know who sent you.
Did you watch TV last night?
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
He shook hands with the mayor.
I usually do the dishes.
We should call the police.
What's the matter with you?
What woke you up?
I can't find the right man for me.
Please take this chart to the X-ray Room on the third floor.
What are the rules again?
You will listen.
You have everything.
Our car broke down on our way there.
We're volunteering.
The crowd cheered.
Are you in a hurry?
I feel like being alone.
I knew I had to tell him the truth, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
When did America become independent of England?
We debated the problem.
Tom's wounded.
They kicked Tom out of the bar.
They changed the system.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
Do not call him master.
I have so many things I want you to know.
Are you having dinner?
You're staying with Tom, right?
I ran out of gas.
She isn't paid monthly, but daily.
Watch closely.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
I waited half an hour for my friend, but he didn't turn up.
There was no one left but me.
Tom got an emergency call and had to leave work.
Don't ever say her name.
I'm not allowed to tell what you want to know.
I respect you.
I want to see your boss.
You need to be more attentive in class.
He picked up a mirror and examined his tongue.
A magnet can pick up and hold many nails at a time.
My father is very tired.
It's on the house.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Are you with the FBI?
We need money.
You can't save me.
I'll be back in just a second.
I want to study abroad next year.
We have to do that as soon as we can.
Tom asked Mary to go to the supermarket to get some milk.
I shouldn't be here.
I'll fix your wagon.
We kept the children quiet.
Talk to me!
I'm not amused.
The capital of Hungary is Budapest.
I like to walk in the rain.
She looked at the picture to refresh her memory.
There are many red flowers in the garden.
I wonder who they are.
Tom has a high opinion of Mary.
Don't make me hurt you again.
She invited me to her home.
His name was becoming widely known.
I have read three books since this morning.
It won't take that long.
That'll take a couple of hours.
A winter sport that many people enjoy is ice skating.
This isn't mine.
I wanted to hear you say that.
I baked it for you.
Would you like another piece of pie?
He wants to meet you.
She is anxious to meet you.
The squirrel climbed the tree.
They jumped through a window into the river.
I was just about to go out, when the bell rang.
The audience exploded with laughter.
I gave up my job.
If you don't talk louder, he won't be able to hear you.
The attempt failed.
It's unlikely that I'll have time to finish this project before next week.
Armenia is a mountainous country.
I keep a good supply of stamps to save trips to the post office.
Tom held his breath.
If you don't get a move on, you'll end up missing your flight.
I live three blocks away.
We'll change trains at the next station.
Tom doesn't seem tired.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
He wrote a lot of stories.
We lost.
Shall we take a taxi?
He is included among my friends.
This house has triple–pane windows.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
They teased the new student.
How can you concentrate?
I'm a little tired.
She advised him to give up smoking, but he wouldn't listen to her.
I remember saying that.
You can depend on it.
She was a great help to me.
Which do you suppose she chose?
How many days are there in a leap year?
Don't shout.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
Her office is on the other side of the street.
I'll set the alarm for seven o'clock.
Tom made a decision.
No one's coming to our party tonight.
I don't have a family.
Tom's wife left him.
I'll show you around town.
I value our friendship.
She tried to conceal her grief at the party.
You can fix all this.
She will accompany me on the piano.
That's it.
Tom knew that Mary was studying French.
The town was deserted.
His hair was brown.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
You want to leave here, don't you?
I didn't go out last Sunday.
Are you afraid of me?
I was moved to tears by the story.
If you hear hoofbeats, don't look for zebras.
Make some noise!
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
I made sure of that.
Letters are delivered every day.
He decided to study harder.
They started dancing.
My homework took longer than I expected.
I think Tom can help.
Tom waited for Mary for three hours.
He's a lovely young man.
Remind me that the meeting is on Monday.
I don't know English.
I'm beginning to feel cold.
Don't put words in my mouth.
What's your GPA?
I know what you want to talk about.
Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?
I'm innocent.
Where's the mistake?
The boys worked hard.
I'm not as rich as you are.
You're very forward.
You might get hurt.
Tom is a student.
I'm glad you decided to come.
I'm what the world calls an idiot.
Unfortunately, I have to get up early every morning.
I am familiar with your name.
He was given the benefit of the doubt.
You may go there.
I have two children.
She stood by him.
You have to trust me.
I like listening to good music.
They didn't keep their promise.
Is there anything you'd like to share?
You have to go on without me.
Many people like to travel.
I know just what you need.
The beach is an ideal place for children to play.
He was stoned.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
I appreciate your telling me.
Are you allergic to any medicines?
I don't date.
Tom warned Mary.
Everything appears to be going well.
I must destroy you.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I risked everything.
I want you to be prepared.
Tom is overemotional.
I didn't notice it.
Someone stole all my money.
You ruined everything.
You should go home early.
The Internet has exploded in popularity.
I remember them.
There are three hundred applicants for only one position.
I was born in 1972.
The bullet penetrated his chest, leaving him in critical condition.
This is the monsoon season.
What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he had said last week.
I've been given permission to inspect this equipment.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
I think it's cruel to keep a cat inside.
Isn't anybody going to say congratulations?
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
I'd like to get married to someone like you.
You have the same camera as mine.
I've got to do my chores.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
The stated price does not include labor charges.
What does she do?
Meeting my old friend was very pleasant.
The train leaves at nine.
It's a matter of priorities.
He often eats breakfast there.
Tom is my prisoner.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
Don't you want to go?
Turn toward me, please.
Have you already met her?
The room is extremely small.
Smoking is not permitted on the train.
What's your favorite non-alcoholic beverage?
You are not Japanese.
I want to spend more time alone with you.
How many apples do you want?
He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
Everybody in the building headed for the exits at the same time.
Fact is stranger than fiction.
You don't have to apologize.
Which student went out?
Were there any problems?
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Where are your suitcases?
She's a glamorous girl.
I would like you to go instead of me.
You should try to form the habit of using your dictionaries.
He is likely to win the game.
I thought hard.
It was harder than I thought.
I'm three years younger than you.
You can rely on him.
You can rely on him.
Are you going to tell me your name?
We just want to live in peace.
They got the short end of the stick.
I bought this for my boyfriend.
I really want to hold your hand.
I am feeling sad about it.
Tom bought Mary lots of jewelry.
How did they do that?
Tom isn't concerned about that.
I'll come as soon as possible.
If he's proficient in English, I'll hire him.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Quit complaining.
Give Tom some water.
We just have to get out of here.
I hate this job.
Cook for me.
They want peace.
Will you help me clean the room?
What's this chair doing here?
Please don't distract me from my work.
We can't accept all of this.
He is considered one of the greatest scientists in our country.
Eat your spinach.
I do not even know what to say to that.
Let's play house.
This trip was your idea.
I didn't know the city, and what's more, I couldn't speak a word of the language.
Tom can't make it tonight.
Yesterday, Mary cleaned the house and washed clothes.
I was so humiliated.
My doctor advised me to give up smoking.
How did we get into so much trouble?
May I try it on?
What can I tell Tom?
I buried it.
You sure have a lot of nerve!
He got a loan from the bank.
Leaves are falling.
The guards didn't see you.
You're forgetful.
He refused to shake hands.
You did the right thing.
Few students could understand what he said.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
How is your daughter?
My father loves doing some tinkering in the garage.
Would you like to be famous?
My dream is to go to Japan.
I don't drink much beer.
I'd like to know the reason why.
Keep that thing away from me.
The police think that Tom poisoned himself.
Tom said we'd find you here.
He's a very nice boy.
The clock has stopped.
A frown may express anger or displeasure.
It was impossible to pull out the cork.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I didn't want to go outside.
What's all the fuss about?
I'm going to be your teacher.
She put it in the box.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
Your question has no answer.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Be kind to those around you.
Who's speaking?
There were more than fifty girls at the party.
I'm feeling low.
I didn't realize you were serious.
What can I get rid of?
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
I think that's enough.
Tom loved teaching French.
I wonder why the dogs are barking.
I took an arrow in the knee.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He is lazy.
I really like that girl.
I like your frankness.
They handled it well.
Why didn't she help you?
We missed the deadline.
Iceland entered into an alliance with France.
I have to open my shop.
Hurry up and bring me something to drink.
I trusted my teacher.
He would rather die than disgrace himself.
I thought you'd gone home.
Not all of them are present.
Tom called Mary every day.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be recovered from radioactive waste material.
No one has ever complained about that.
Come quick!
You must respect your elders.
It could be a trap.
He seldom gets angry.
Tom watched his granddaughters dance.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
I don't have to listen to that.
I am very tall.
It's a magnificent view, isn't it?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You're a bodybuilder, aren't you?
Did you drop it?
Call me right back.
He filed a complaint.
Tom wouldn't let me call an ambulance so I drove him to the hospital myself.
We will present our idea to the committee.
I have to learn many words and phrases by heart.
He said, "I want to be a scientist."
You're a romantic.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
It rained for hours and hours.
They're acting on their own.
I fell asleep before my father came home.
I'm not well.
I advise you to change clothes.
She advised him to see the dentist.
He bought a pair of shoes.
You know what song I want to sing.
The baby was quiet all night.
I'm going to take my vacation in September rather than July.
Are you still working for Tom?
Frankly, I don't care.
Toward midnight, I fell asleep.
Come quickly!
I could get punished if I did that.
She returned the book to the library.
I'm vegetarian.
What is all that stuff?
It was a national scandal.
Air is to us what water is to fish.
Do you have a shoehorn?
We were both drunk.
Do you like my new haircut?
We didn't hear you come in.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
We're stubborn.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
Do you know how his father died?
He was the last person I had expected to see during my stay in America.
I no longer believe that.
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
I have been to the U.S. twice.
He must have missed his usual train.
I guess I should've known Tom wasn't going to help.
I told you to leave.
They must be cops.
He used to get up early.
What's the commotion?
You've got to be bold!
Did you do what I asked?
How heavy is your suitcase?
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
I'm going to go buy some materials today.
You would make a great mother.
It'll be better next time.
He did the opposite.
How long have you been ill?
We have come a long way.
I see a pattern.
This showy dress isn't appropriate for me.
She is among those unaccounted for.
I've already made it.
His salary can't keep pace with inflation.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
Can you tell me where I am?
They are in the same class.
That's going to take some time.
She grows tomatoes in her garden.
There's someone I want you to meet.
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
This book is interesting.
This is not my specialty.
You're my only real friend.
I need an extension cord.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
These are decisions I want to make alone.
Does the medicine act quickly?
Tom went abroad to study French.
You must take care of your dog.
Vigorous exercise makes you sweat.
He put on an air of innocence.
She congratulated me on my success.
I need help translating this document into French.
Why don't you take a break?
Neither is beautiful.
They are artists.
You must think this is funny.
I was ready.
Why is he looking at me?
Music and art can greatly contribute to the enjoyment of life.
Tom may come and visit me any time he wants to.
Do you remember me?
This no longer matters.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
We're both wrong.
She lives in this house by herself.
I can't praise him enough.
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
I want to know who they are.
We're stuck.
He's hopelessly in love.
I'm going to the supermarket to do some shopping.
The engineer told us how to use the machine.
This child solved the complicated mathematics problem easily.
Tom doesn't like basketball.
It may break.
Mary and Alice are sisters.
I don't want to talk about that today.
We must assume the worst.
I repeated my name.
I know who gave that to you.
Why do you want to do that?
It's what we always planned.
I hate all of them.
A strange feeling came over me.
Where's the pharmacy?
You're not expecting me to help you, are you?
I could never be like that.
After using the knife, please be sure to put it back where it was.
They made sure nobody could see them.
Come over.
Are they Japanese?
Let's do this now.
I threw the strange package on the table.
When you love someone, you'll do anything to make that person happy.
He chose not to run for the presidential election.
Keep focused on your work.
I trust we're all alone.
Do you plan to stay long?
I'm aware of that.
She shaved her head.
I'm glad you liked my friends.

We need more time.
I just thought you might want to talk.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Could you speak a little louder please?
Are you going or staying?
The more I get, the more I want.
He is married to an American lady.
I really need your help.
I don't really know you.
I rescued her.
She never dreamed she'd meet him overseas.
He has ten cows.
Tom doesn't usually play backgammon.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
Curiosity got the better of him.
When I got out of jail, I wanted to patch up things with my wife.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
The exact same thing happened to me.
I took over the business from my father.
They all hugged.
Our cow doesn't give us any milk.
I'm one of your employees.
I don't think we need that.
You're not easy to find.
My tummy hurts.
They're right behind me.
Tom was popular.
Do you have a pen or pencil?
Thank you just the same.
I think I did well.
I'll be free.
Was that you at the door?
I had an interesting day today.
He knows a lot about flowers.
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
What's your favorite item of clothing?
My parents wouldn't understand.
I feel lonely.
The movie was disappointing.
I'd be glad to tell Tom how to do that.
There is always something happening here.
I lit the match.
What did Tom want us to do?
I didn't have much time.
I tried to talk a friend of mine out of getting married.
You want to know the truth, don't you?
He is opening the window.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
Don't you have work to do?
It was yesterday that I saw him walking down the street.
I want you to run to the store for me.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
What did you do to get grounded?
When did all this start?
She sat next to me.
You don't have to sing.
Don't move unless I tell you.
He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
Why don't you sit and have a drink with me?
Isn't that nice?
I saw him.
I had too much to drink and I can barely walk.
The toilet is upstairs.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
I know you want to make me happy.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Let's do it!
Tom said he heard an explosion.
Each time I see this picture, I remember my father.
Tom always wears sunglasses, even indoors.
I'm not sure where Tom lives.
I've been debating whether I should mention it or not.
We have far better things to do with our time.
I'm doing all I can.
The company abandoned that project.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
I was home all day yesterday.
Is it dangerous?
Could you check this for me?
Tom was very tired.
You don't want to know.
What are you good at?
I don't appreciate being lied to.
Let me see.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
Are you working?
I know it's not possible.
I feel like doing something different today.
Can you prove it?
It's easy if you try.
I think I hear them.
He wanted to buy the book.
Today, I'm not going to school.
Your proposal is a bit extreme.
They seem to be having fun.
Call me right back.
Anyone over eighteen years of age counts as an adult.
He's running for Congress.
I know Tom will be reasonable.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
Could I use your phone?
I'm sure Tom will do that.
Sugar dissolves in water.
Tom has to learn Japanese because he's going to Japan next year.
Bring it back when you're done.
The delegations of both countries met in Geneva.
This photo is too blurry. I can't make out your face.
That's all I ever wanted.
You must prepare yourself for the worst.
I'll treat you.
You seem a little tense.
I can't let you.
Tom is merciless.
It's as you say.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
This is yours, isn't it?
She's fond of taking pictures.
She accused him of being inattentive to her.
Who called you?
Don't breathe a word of this to my girlfriend.
Tom is my husband's best friend.
I have to go to sleep.
I'll destroy it.
I tried to open the door, but I couldn't since it was locked.
Nowadays, traveling costs a lot of money.
His doctor ordered him to rest.
We went to Boston by bus.
I finally found my keys.
Did you put it somewhere?
Let's begin with the first chapter.
Do you get many visitors?
I didn't know what it was at the time.
I can't do all of this without a little help.
I would do anything but that.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I haven't read any of his novels.
He gets a kick out of reckless driving.
I must find some new friends.
If he had worked harder, he could have succeeded.
Can I eat my lunch here?
We broke up.
Don't hurt anyone.
I'm not sure if Tom can do that.
You taught me a lot.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
You don't sound very optimistic.
You'll have to study harder from now on.
It took me several hours to translate it.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
He doesn't have enough experience.
This is your pilot speaking.
He got more than he bargained for.
Tom cries every time he hears this song.
I want to be invited.
Do you want to hear my theory?
I'm sorry, my father's not here.
I had to stay in bed all day.
We know it was you that broke the window.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
I want to eat steak.
Do you want some water?
I didn't want you to leave me.
Is there any beer left?
What are you still doing here?
I hate to eat alone.
Your children look healthy.
I think I'll snooze for a while.
Who wrote the Bible?
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
I've taken care of that.
Who is your teacher?
I don't like that name.
If I'd had a little more money, I would have bought it.
He is fighting with his back against the wall.
I'll try to fix it later.
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
He took off his clothes.
No doubt she will come soon.
Her voice doesn't carry.
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
I have been living in Canada for almost five years.
I'm totally confused.
Shake hands with him.
A mere glance is not enough for us to tell one from the other.
I don't know how to thank you.
You're too suspicious about everything.
I hated history class.
His plan was discarded.
Is that seriously what you think?
How come you know so much?
You better hurry.
Tom is still in the classroom studying.
Our sales are decreasing.
That's not what happened.
He fell backward.
Give it to me straight.
Things are complicated.
It doesn't work so well because the batteries are running down.
It's artificial.
A very large number of tourists visit Kyoto in the spring.
I can't put up with this noise anymore.
It is terrible weather today.
They knew how much danger they were in.
I know you've been busy.
Tom says he didn't cry.
I like to finish what I start.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
I don't know everybody in this school.
Do you have the painting?
We could've made a fortune.
I'm not a drug addict.
Do you have any Japanese beer?
Add more water to it.
She is fond of animals.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
Why did you call me?
I'm surprised Tom can't speak French.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
I'm really surprised you got a prize.
You know the drill.
The bus stop is across the street.
That's exactly what I want to hear.
Show me where it happened.
I wasn't invited.
Close your eyes and picture a log house.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
Today's meeting has been canceled.
I like you very much.
He said he would call tomorrow.
He has a nose bleed.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Where did you put the TV guide?
I am ashamed about what happened yesterday.
You've come too early.
Talking to him always puts me in a good mood.
He mentioned her name for the first time.
I finally got a job.
Could I get my ring back?
I'm the only one who can do that.
What if there's a leak?
Tom told Mary that he had a new girlfriend.
It is not impossible.
There was an old clunker parked just behind my new sports car.
They're not always right.
I'm exhausted.
He is sitting cross-legged.
I had no idea that you were having problems with Tom.
Don't you want to be in love again?
What's the precise meaning of that word?
Why didn't you call somebody?
It'd be better to avoid her now, because she's violent.
Keep trying.
Are you new here?
What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Classes start at eight in the morning.
Have you received an answer to your letter?
After lunch we have two more classes.
Don't approach the dog.
It's bad for you.
Are you ready to party?
I'll check with you later.
Some would say that he's playing with fire.
I want to ask you some questions.
Tom claims he knows nothing about Mary.
My uncle gave his car to me.
Why are we studying French?
I'll get you whatever you want.
She was always ready to help people in trouble.
I don't know why Tom hates me so much.
Bless you.
It's our duty.
Tom doesn't think it will snow this afternoon.
We bought a round table.
He calculated that it would cost him 100 dollars.
Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
Once you've started something, don't give it up.
This is probably a real diamond.
There are some things that I don't understand.
The television doesn't work.
The manufacturer guaranteed the new machine for 5 years.
They're downstairs.
That writer is well known all over the world.
Answer the phone, please.
What other options do I have?
Let's just sit here a while and listen.
Mary oiled her bicycle.
He is very friendly to us.
Aren't we lucky?
They can't stop you.
Go away.
I don't understand what this means at all.
We'll talk again in the morning.
We can't let this continue.
Tom left thirty minutes ago.
I am more than grateful to you for your help.
I can't let you in there.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.
Forget it.
I was distracted.
What do you say to calling it a day?
I'm not old.
I hear it's buried under all that snow.
I just didn't want you in here.
That's a big blow.
My father is in the garden now.
The Sahara is the largest desert in the world.
Do you follow?
I tried to learn the melody by heart.
He likes walking in the park.
She idolized him.
It's the best hotel in this town.
We never talked about that again.
I had a very nice time.
The problem resolved itself.
He has ambition, so he works hard.
Can you take this call for me?
Tom isn't playing by the rules.
Can you catch the chicken?
We washed our feet.
If you don't know, who does?
Everybody's home.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
I thought we could get together later.
You're my only real friend.
When you come next time, bring your brother.
Can you solve this problem?
I don't have any ideas at this time.
My hands were shaking too much to thread the needle.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I can talk to him for hours.
I want to teach history when I grow up.
I love you guys.
I must be going deaf.
Tom still needs practice.
How's your job going?
The band starts playing at 8:00 p.m.
Which is your target?
I'm a little tired today.
I like the sound of your voice.
I went to school on foot in those days.
That's my favorite expression.
He gave it to me.
I want to be with you.
I figured you might want a drink.
Do you understand French?
Tom can't speak French.
You're avoiding me.
There is a tinge of red in the eastern sky.
He is smelling the soup.
The girls danced to music.
I hear you are good at cooking.
My father cut wood with a saw.
The children went out to play.
I don't have the slightest idea.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
I asked Tom.
Tom is outside watering the flowers.
What you are is more important than what you have.
Are you being followed?
She has never seen him.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
The police caught the burglar red-handed.
Had she known the results, she would have been shocked.
The sun is rising.
Please note that the price is subject to change.
He did a cartwheel.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
You're early.
He knows how to swim.
Which way are you going?
We're classmates.
I helped my parents with the housework.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I'm not home on Sundays.
It will make little difference whether you go there by taxi or on foot.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Don't get me started.
I am glad to see her.
My leg's gone to sleep, so I don't think I can stand up right away.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
She quit her job for some reason.
You are seriously ill.
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
Everyone looks the same, except the one standing on his head.
I married off my daughter.
I'd like two kilos of apples.
I know Tom was horrified.
The boy lay listening to the radio.
I outrank you.
I know what you could've done.
What time shall I pick you up?
Dogs wag their tails and cats swish theirs.
I would prefer any alternative to a lawsuit.
We have to obey orders.
Tom speaks perfect French.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
It's not far to Boston.
He's a little taller than you are.
Why are you so tired?
It is warmer today than yesterday.
You are twice as strong as me.
Don't you have any change?
My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
Can you call him?
The more worthless the plant, the more rapid and splendid is its growth.
I felt excited.
You had better make use of the opportunity.
I hope we can avoid that.
This coat is rainproof.
I've been tricked.
You are drunk!
Why didn't you call me up?
I want to leave Paris.
The competition is fierce.
I love traveling alone.
Check these out.
You shouldn't make fun of Tom.
Have you got it yet?
Anything could happen.
Your pitching is far superior to mine.
I have nothing to do today.
It was OK.
We have room.
You know what they say.
Do you know a good dentist?
Tom is a grown man.
I will study German.
We must take care of our planet, the earth.
They came last week.
How do you intend to do it?
Beijing is bigger than Rome.
Rear end collisions often cause whiplash.
You don't sound convinced.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I'm not a child.
We rent movies all the time.
He is asleep.
Could you please tell me the truth?
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
You must work hard, if you want to succeed.
She listened to him.
I don't know exactly.
I met her on the way to school.
She always speaks English.
I want to spend all my time with you.
Please tell me how to pronounce this word.
No one could deny this.
My boss is very strict.
Come and see me whenever you like.
What's your address?
Did you send them?
It's almost half past eleven.
My son grew 5 inches last year.
You're running short of time.
You don't have to apologize.
Which hat is yours?
I have an older brother.
I felt cheated.
It made me forget about my problems.
I wish that I could give you something.
Monday was a busy day.
I have tennis elbow.
Could you come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
The doctor gave it to her.
I have difficulty in understanding him.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
We're not kidding.
Don't act like that.
What's that stain?
It doesn't work, does it?
I am relieved that you are safe.
I bumped into an old friend on the bus.
It's not as easy to do that as people think.
He has few friends.
I'm a terrible writer.
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
You're not going to do it, are you?
I'd like to go to the zoo.
You should concentrate on one thing and learn to do it well.
I have just come back from school.
As soon as I can figure out how to send money, I'll send you some.
Tom bought a parrot.
How many caps do you own?
Is there someone with you?
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
I don't like the dark.
Tom is probably just a little younger than Mary.
You should see what Tom can do.
Why is snow white?
My heart skipped a beat when my wife told me she was pregnant.
I'm not like that anymore.
She is on a diet to lose weight.
I won't be at home tonight.
The city was soon occupied by the soldiers.
May I have your name and address?
I think Tom is ready.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
Humans originated in Africa.
Something is wrong with our electric heater.
He was visibly nervous.
I had something planned.
I want you to have a job that you love.
She called out to us for help.
Everyone seems to agree.
You're all racists.
What else can you tell us?
Tom likes skiing, too.
Tom isn't qualified for that job.
I'm reliable.
I fell down the steps.
Maybe Tom asked Mary to lie.
You must be in good physical condition.
We are going to the shop.
We weren't able to buy tickets, so we didn't go to the concert.
We're hoping to visit Boston this summer.
That's a good brand.
I remember that vividly.
Who's the composer of this symphony?
Have you already finished?
It's a problem we do not have any answer for.
I applied for a visa.
Tell me what Tom took with him.
There was a church here once.
It's out of the question.
We've run out of ammunition.
The drug problem is international.
That probably is true.
There's a new sheriff in town.
I can't say I'm shocked.
You're very upset.
I can't do more than that.
You won't stay, will you?
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?
You can't just not go to work.
I really appreciate you helping me.
I appreciate your concern.
You may come at any time tomorrow afternoon.
Tom drowned.
Keep in mind that you must die.
You don't know me at all.
I'm meeting Tom for lunch at a restaurant on Park Street.
Yours is not bad, either.
The stock price index soared to an all-time high.
What did they expect?
Call me tomorrow.
Tom will play tennis tomorrow.
You should know that by now.
The meeting was called off.
She always walks to school.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Hang on a second.
I'll show you the way out.
Do your homework now.
I'll see you at the party.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
He's ruthless.
I was tired so I went to bed.
Tom asked me to pick Mary up at the airport.
All in all, the international conference was a success.
This book will awaken your imagination.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
If I'd only taken your advice!
They hoped to sell the stocks at even higher prices.
I'd like to study French.
I'm a diabetic.
I'm not the only one who saw Tom swimming yesterday evening.
I don't want you to be upset.
He glanced at her.
I have plans.
Tom thought about what Mary said.
You must all leave.
This book is much more useful than that one.
We're not related.
Is your suitcase as heavy as it looks?
He will be coming to the party.
My nose is stuffed up.
What a lucky person he is!
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say.
Don't make the same mistake twice.
Tom will come this afternoon.
It was in 1912 that the Titanic sank during her first voyage.
Tom didn't take a bath last night.
He is afraid of snakes.
You shouldn't have said that kind of thing to him.
I've got exactly 13 dollars in my pocket.
I hear that Mary is very pretty.
It's time.
Tom is as tall as his father.
I remember meeting him in Paris.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice sat around the fire.
Is that pure gold?
Please be serious.
See you tomorrow.
I'm rather proud of it.
I will call on you again.
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
Bad weather prevented us from departing.
I cannot put up with her behavior.
Mt. Fuji is higher than any other mountain in Japan.
Sometimes I hear things.
The workers worked around the clock.
Tom told us to take our time.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
Take off your clothes.
Tom and I never lie to each other.
The heat kept me awake all night.
Here are the documents you asked for.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
This suit is anything but cheap.
I moved here yesterday.
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
I have a poor imagination.
I often catch colds in the winter.
You can come home.
I know who my enemies are.
I loved you.
Pay at the cash register.
You seem busy.
Please write down your contact address here.
I still don't know what I'm going to say.
Tom calls Mary every night.
I'm just getting started.
Are you still recovering from last night?
Your threats don't scare me at all.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
Are drinks free?
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
The earliest civilizations arose in Mesopotamia.
I did something bad.
The CEO is trying to quash these unfounded rumors about a merger.
I entered her room.
Tom doesn't want to get his hands dirty.
I just got your message.
I was scared to be alone in the dark.
This car needs to be washed.
He walked through the forest.
I confessed to stealing the money.
I've asked you this question before.
You don't know how much I love you.
I thought we were welcome here.
I don't know how to contact you.
I didn't know about it.
Let me have a look at it, will you?
Let's open a bottle of wine.
Nobody's ever heard of him.
She entered this school last year.
I feel a little insecure.
They have drunk two bottles of wine.
Tom concentrated on his work.
We're out of ammo.
Learning French takes time.
What does this sentence mean?
I've never heard of you.
He passed away.
It's time to get out of here.
I really wish I could be there with you.
How long did you stay?
Be friendly.
Remind me to never do that again.
I know the perfect place for our party.
They said they would not fight.
Tom is a Native American.
He told me that he would leave before long.
He spent the morning reading a book.
Tell me where he is.
It's a bit warm in here, isn't it?
The older we get, the weaker our memory becomes.
Where can I go to buy art books and catalogs?
I don't know how to handle this.
I wish you had told me that.
He died ten years ago.
He looked well.
Now that you have finished your work, you are free to go home.
Isn't that Tom's hat?
Have you decided on the subject of your thesis?
Who are your parents?
You're the one who trained me.
How long did you stay?
Why didn't you listen to me?
He goes running every morning.
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
I have my friend's car at my disposal.
He was killed by a blunt weapon.
Why is that of interest?
I go grocery shopping every morning.
Please choose a more secure password.
I appreciate your telling me.
He was killed in a car accident.
They didn't choose me.
I walked to school.
I'm driving.
The girls had a catfight.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Tom's famous.
I brought you this.
She visits us every other day.
Things were never the same after that.
Hey, where are you?
They accused me of being a liar.
Do you drink coffee?
Nothing is the matter with me.
There are no other options.
What were they doing here?
Tom took a day off.
Tom said he doesn't know anyone in Boston.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not married yet.
Don't expect too much of him.
This is for your own safety.
I have a little money now.
Can he see us?
Run for it!
Let's face reality.
It's on my desk.
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
The government should do away with these regulations.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
Yolks are yellow.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
I don't care who does this.
Are you children all right?
The small boy slowly made some new friends.
That was really weird.
What's the score?
The young worker was asked to resign.
He began running.
Come join us.
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
I didn't feel very well, but I went to work anyway.
We'll talk about that later.
He lost his memory.
You must repay your debts.
She is certainly over forty.
The cold weather slowed the growth of the rice plants.
I would like to exchange this shirt that I bought yesterday.
Can you take the lid off this box?
I was on my knees.
I heard you don't eat meat.
I'm not insane.
Let me go!
We're going east.
Everything's going be all right.
You are the most important person in my life.
When did you begin learning English?
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
I am fond of skiing.
I suppose you're hungry.
I almost never listen to the radio.
You don't want to keep him waiting.
They trusted you.
Well done, Tom.
Should I tell Tom to ask Mary to sing?
Don't dismiss any possibility.
I've lost my wallet.
I've just been punished.
Let's take a tea break.
I didn't even see you once last year.
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
Nothing is more important than health.
Tom took the hook out of the fish's mouth.
Hang your coat on the hook.
What can I tell you?
I haven't been completely honest with you.
You need to move on.
It's your duty to finish the job.
You aren't afraid of ghosts, are you?
Keep driving.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
He should have kept his mouth shut.
I asked them to fix my car.
Choose any of these pens.
You're in love with Tom, aren't you?
Don't move until I tell you to.
The train was almost an hour behind time.
Have a seat.
He looks tired this evening.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
I only know what you tell me.
We wish him all success in his future endeavor.
Did I blow it?
That's amazing!
I think what impressed me most was the way Tom could talk to just about anyone.
I still need to talk to Tom.
Don't sneak up on me like that.
You can't trust computer translation.
I felt happy.
He prefers football to baseball.
How can you not know?
Tom died in Boston in 2013 when he was 30 years old.
She put on her hat to go out.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
Don't believe her because she always lies.
Is anything missing?
Is there hot water?
It's too easy.
Tom's guilty.
We can deliver it this evening.
They look confused.
Please knock before you come in.
If only you'd thought of that before shooting your big mouth off.
I'll do all the talking.
I put some cream in my coffee.
What does that cost?
Everything's OK now.
Let's give it one more try.
Why don't you talk to him?
I don't like this weather.
I think that she knows the truth.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
I didn't take it that seriously.
I'm a singer.
